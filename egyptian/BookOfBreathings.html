outside, (wrapped) in royal linen, and it is placed &lt;under&gt;
the (6) left arm near his heart. The bearer makes (7) his coffin

<p><b>II</b>. Beginning
[of the Book of Breathings] which [Isis] made [for her brother,
Osiris to cause his soul to live, to cause his body to live, to
rejuvenate all his limbs] (2) again, [so that he might join] the
horizon with his father, Re, [and to cause his soul to appear in
heave as the disk of the moon, so that his body might shine like
Orion in the womb of Nut, to] (3) cause [the same] thing to
happen to the Osiris, Hôr, justified, [born of Taikhebyt,
justified. Keep it secret!] (4) Do not let anyone read it. It is
useful [ for one in the necropolis. He will live again

robbery.</p>

<p>(18) O One with the

you (5) without any evil committed by him, without any
wrong-doing held against him, and without any witness who rises
up against him. He lives by righteousness. He consumes
righteousness. The hearts of the gods are content with all that
he has done. (6) He has given bread to the hungry, water to the
thirsty, clothing to the naked. He has given offerings to the
gods and invocation offerings to the blessed dead. There is no
accusation against him before any of the gods. Let him enter into
the afterlife without being turned away. Let him accompany Osiris
together with the gods (8) of the cavern, for he has life,
prosperity, and health among the living, and he is divine among
the justified dead. Let him live, and let his soul live. Let (9)
his soul be admitted into any place he desires. Accept his Book
of Breathings. Let him breathe together with that soul of his in
(10) the afterlife with any form his heart desires together with
the Westerners. Let his soul go wherever it wants. Let him live
upon the earth forever and ever.</p>
