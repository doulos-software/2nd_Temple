<h2 align="center">The Flood Narrative From the Gilgamesh Epic</h2>

<p>Gilgamesh has made a long and difficult journey to learn how Utnapishtim acquired
eternal life. In answer to his questions, Utnapishtim tells the following story. Once upon
a time, the gods destroyed the ancient city of Shuruppak in a great flood. But
Utnapishtim, forewarned by Ea (=Enki), managed to survive by building a great ship. His
immortality was a gift bestowed by the repentant gods in recognition of his ingenuity and
his faithfulness in reinstituting the sacrifice. <br>
<br>
Shurippak - a city which thou knowest,<br>
(And) which on Euphrates&#146; banks is set -<br>
That city was ancient, (as were) the gods within it,<br>
When their heart led the great gods to produce the flood.<br>
There were Anu, their father,<br>
Valiant Enlil, their counsellor,<br>
Ninurta, their herald,<br>
Ennuge, their irrigator.<br>
Ninigiku-Ea was also present with them;<br>
Their words he repeats to the reed-hut (home of Utnapishtim):<br>
&#145;Reed-hut, reed-hut! Wall! Wall!<br>
Reed-hut, hearken! Wall, reflect!<br>
Man of Shuruppak (Utnapishtim), son of Ubar-Tutu,<br>
Tear down (this) house, build a ship!<br>
Give up possessions, seek thou life.<br>
Despise property and keep the soul alive.<br>
Aboard the ship take thou the seed of all living things.<br>
The ship that thou shalt build,<br>
Her dimensions shall be to measure.<br>
Equal shall be her width and her length.<br>
Like the Apsu (subterranean waters) thou shalt ceil her.&#146;<br>
<br>
I understood, and I said to Ea, my lord:<br>
&#145;Behold, my lord, what thou has thus ordered,<br>
I shall be honoured to carry out.<br>
But what shall I answer the city, the people and elders?&#146;<br>
Ea opened his mouth to speak,<br>
Saying to me, his servant:<br>
&#145;Thou shalt then thus speak unto them:<br>
I have learned that Enlil is hostile to me,<br>
So that I cannot reside in your city,<br>
Nor set my foot in Enlil&#146;s territory.<br>
To the Deep I will therefore go down,<br>
To swell with my lord Ea.<br>
But upon you he will shower down abundance,<br>
The choicest birds, the rarest fishes.<br>
The land shall have its fill of harvest riches.<br>
He who at dusk orders the husk-greens,Will shower down upon you a rain of wheat (...to
deceive the residents of Shurrupak as to the real intent of the rain).&#146; <br>
With the first glow of dawn,<br>
The land was gathered about me.<br>
[too fragmentary for translation]<br>
<br>
The little ones carried bitumen,<br>
While the grown ones brought all else that was needful.<br>
On the fifth day I laid her framework.<br>
One (whole ) acre was her floor space,<br>
Ten dozen cubits the height of each of her walls,<br>
The dozen cubits each edge of the square deck.<br>
I laid out the shape of her sides and joined her together.<br>
I provided her with six decks,<br>
Dividing her (thus) into seven parts,<br>
Her floor plan I divided into nine parts.<br>
I hammered water-plugs into her.<br>
I saw to the punting-poles and laid in supplies.<br>
Six &#145;sar&#146; (measures - about 8 gallons) of bitumen I poured into the furnace,<br>
Three sar of asphalt I also poured inside.<br>
Three sar of the basket-bearers transferred,<br>
Aside from the one sar of oil which the caulking consumed,<br>
And the two sar of oil which the boatman stowed away.<br>
Bullocks I slaughtered for the people,<br>
And I killed sheep every day.<br>
Must, red wine, oil, and white wine<br>
I gave the workmen to drink, as though river water,<br>
That they might feast as on New Year&#146;s Day...<br>
On the seventh day the ship was completed.<br>
The launching was very difficult,<br>
So that they had to shift the floor planks above and below,<br>
Until two-thirds of the structure had gone into the water.<br>
Whatever I had I laded upon her;<br>
Whatever I had of silver I laded upon her;<br>
Whatever I had of gold I laded upon her;<br>
Whatever I had of all the living being I laded upon her.<br>
All my family and kin I made go aboard the ship.<br>
The beasts of the field, the wild creatures of the field,<br>
All the craftsmen I made go aboard.<br>
Shamash had set for me a stated time:<br>
&#145;When he who orders unease at night<br>
Will shower down a rain of blight,<br>
Board thou the ship and batten up the gate!&#146;<br>
That stated time had arrived:<br>
&#145;He who orders unease at night showers down a rain of blight.&#146;<br>
I watched the appearance of the weather.<br>
The weather was awesome of behold.<br>
I boarded the ship and battened up the gate.<br>
To batten up the (whole) ship, to Puzur-Amurri, the boatman,<br>
I handed over the structure together with its contents.<br>
With the flirst glow of dawn,<br>
A black cloud rose up from the horizon.<br>
Inside it Adad (god of storm and rain) thunders,<br>
While Shallat and Hanish (Heralds of Adad) go in front,<br>
Moving as heralds over hill and plain.<br>
Erragal (Nergal, the god of the netherworld) tears out the posts (out of the dam); <br>
Forth comes Ninurta and causes the dikes to follow.<br>
The Anunnaki lift up the torches,<br>
Setting the land ablaze with their glare.<br>
Consternation over Adad reaches to the heavens,<br>
Turning to blackness all that had been light.<br>
The wide land was shattered like a pot!<br>
For one day the south-storm blew,<br>
Gathering speed as it blew, submerging the mountains,<br>
Overtaking the people like a battle.<br>
No one can see his fellow,<br>
Nor can the people be recognized from heaven. <br>
The gods were frightened by the deluge,<br>
And, shrinking back, they ascended to the heaven of Anu.<br>
The gods cowered like dogs<br>
Crouched against the outer wall.<br>
Ishtar cried out like a woman in travail,<br>
The sweet-voiced mistress of the gods moans aloud:<br>
&#145;The olden days are alas turned to clay,<br>
Because I bespoke evil in the Assembly of the gods,<br>
How could I bespeak evil in the Assembly of the gods,<br>
Ordering battle for the destruction of my people,<br>
When it is I myself who give birth to my people!<br>
Like the spawn of the fishes they fill the sea!&#146;<br>
The Anunnaki gods weep with her,<br>
Their lips drawn tight,...one and all.<br>
Six days and six nights<br>
Blows the flood wind, as the south-storm sweeps the land.<br>
When the seventh day arrived,<br>
The flood (-carrying) south-storm subsided in the battle,<br>
Which it had fought like an army.<br>
The sea grew quiet, the tempest was still, the flood ceased.<br>
I looked at the weather: stillness had set in,<br>
And all of mankind has returned to clay.<br>
The landscape was as level as a flat roof.<br>
I opened a hatch, and light fell on my face.<br>
Bowing low, I sat and wept,<br>
Tears running down my face.<br>
I looked about the coast lines in the expanse of the sea:<br>
In each of fourteen (regions)<br>
There emerged a region (-mountain).<br>
On Mount Nisir the ship came to a halt.<br>
Mount Nisir held the ship fast,<br>
Allowing no motion.<br>
<br>
(Indecipherable or missing)<br>
[For six days the ship is held fast by Mount Nisir.]<br>
When the seventh day arrived,<br>
I sent forth and set free a dove.<br>
The dove went forth, but came back;<br>
There was no resting place for it and she turned round.<br>
Then I sent forth and set free a swallow.<br>
The swallow went forth, but came back;<br>
There was no resting-place for it and she turned round.<br>
<br>
Then I sent forth and set free a raven.<br>
The raven went forth and, seeing that the waters had diminished,<br>
He eats, circles, caws, and turns not around.<br>
The I let out (all) to the four winds<br>
And offered a sacrifice.<br>
I poured out a libation on the top of the mountain.<br>
Seven and seven cult-vessels I set up<br>
Upon their plate-stands I heaped cane, cedarwood, and myrtle.<br>
The gods smelled the savour,<br>
The gods smelled the sweet savour,<br>
The gods crowded like flies about the sacrificer.<br>
As soon as the great goddess (Ishtar=Ninhurti) arrived,<br>
She lifted up the great jewels which Anu had fashioned to her liking:<br>
&#145;Ye gods here, as surely as this lapis<br>
Upon my neck I shall not forget,<br>
I shall be mindful of these days, forgetting (them) never.<br>
Let the gods come and to the offering:<br>
(But) let not Enlil come to the offering,<br>
<br>
For he, unreasoning, brought on the deluge<br>
And my people consigned to destruction.&#146;<br>
<br>
As soon as Enlil arrived,<br>
And saw the ship, Enlil was wroth,<br>
He was filled the wrath against the Igigi gods (heavenly gods): <br>
&#145;Has some living soul escaped?<br>
No man was to survive the destruction!&#146;<br>
<br>
Ninurta opened his mouth to speak,<br>
Saying to valiant Enlil:<br>
&#145;Who other than Ea can devise plans?<br>
It is Ea alone who knows every matter.&#146;<br>
Ea opened his mouth to speak,<br>
Saying to valiant Enlil:<br>
&#145;Thou wisest of the gods, thou hero,<br>
How couldst thou, unreasoning, bring on the deluge?<br>
On the sinner impose his sin, <br>
On the transgressor impose his transgression!<br>
(Yet) be lenient, lest he be cut off,<br>
Be patient, lest he be dislodged!<br>
<br>
Instead of they bringing on the deluge,<br>
Would that a lion had risen up to diminish mankind!<br>
Instead of thy bringing on the deluge,<br>
Would that a wolf had risen up to diminish mankind!<br>
Instead of thy bringing up the deluge,<br>
Would that pestilence had risen up to smite down mankind!<br>
It was not I who disclosed the secret of the great gods.<br>
I let Atrahasis ('Exceedingly wise,' an epithet of Utnapishtim) see a dream,<br>
And he perceived the secret of the gods.<br>
<br>
Now then take counsel in regard to him!&#146;<br>
Thereupon Enlil went aboard the ship.<br>
Holding me by the hand, he took me aboard.<br>
He took my wife aboard and made (her) kneel by my side.<br>
Standing between us, he touched our foreheads to bless us:<br>
&#145;Hitherto Utnapishtim has been but human.<br>
Henceforth Utnapishtim and his wife shall be like unto us gods.<br>
Utnapishtim shall reside far away, at the mouth of the rivers!&#146;<br>
Thus they took me and made me reside far away,<br>
At the mouth of the rivers.<br>
