<blockquote>Jesus Christ, the Son of God [...] from ...
<br><i>... (2 lines unrecoverable)</i>
<br>... the aeons, that I might tell all of the aeons, and, in (the case
of) each one of the aeons, that I might tell the nature of the aeon, what
it is, and that I might put on friendship and goodness as a garment, O
brother, [...] and ...
<br><i>... (7 lines unrecoverable)</i>
<br>... their end [...]. And he will reveal to them the truth [...] in
...
<br><i>... (3 lines unrecoverable)</i>
<br>... proverb(s) ...
<br><i>... (lines 26-eop, and first 2 lines of next page, unrecoverable)</i>
<br>... at first in parables and riddles [...] proclaim them. Death will
tremble and be angry, not only he himself, but also his fellow world-ruling
archons, and the principalities and the authorities, the female gods and
the male gods, together with the archangels. And ...
<br><i>... (4 lines unrecoverable)</i>
<br>... all of them, [...] the world-rulers [...], all of them, and all
the [...], and all the [...].</blockquote>

<blockquote>They will say [...] concerning him, and concerning [...] and
...
<br><i>... (2 lines unrecoverable)</i>
<br>... they will [...] hidden mysteries ...
<br><i>... (lines 27-eop, and first 2 lines of next page, unrecoverable)</i>
<br>... out of [...] the All. They will [...] this. The lawyers will bury
him quickly. They will call him 'impious man', 'lawless', 'impure'. And
on the third day, he will rise from the dead ...
<br><i>... (lines 12-eop, and first 3 lines of next page, unrecoverable)</i>
<br>... holy disciples. And the Savior will reveal to them the world that
gives life to the All.</blockquote>

<blockquote>But those in the heavens spoke many words, together with those
on the earth, and those under the earth. ...
<br><i>... (lines 11-eop unrecoverable)</i></blockquote>

<blockquote>... which will happen in his name. Furthermore, they will say
of him that he is unbegotten, though he has been begotten, (that) he does
not eat, even though he eats, (that) he does not drink, even though he
drinks, (that) he is uncircumcised, though he has been circumcised, (that)
he is unfleshly, though he has come in the flesh, (that) he did not come
to suffering, &lt;though&gt; he came to suffering, (that) he did not rise
from the dead, &lt;though&gt; he arose from the dead.</blockquote>

<blockquote>But all the tribes and all the peoples will speak the truth
who are receiving from you yourself, O Melchizedek, Holy One, High-Priest,
the perfect hope and the gifts of life. I am Gamaliel, who was sent to
[...] the congregation of the children of Seth, who are above thousands
of thousands, and myriads of myriads, of the aeons [...] essence of the
aeons, aba[...] aiai ababa. O divine [...] of the [...] nature [...]! O
Mother of the aeons, Barbelo! O first-born of the aeons, splendid Doxomedon
Dom[...]! O glorious one, Jesus Christ! O chief commanders of the luminaries,
you powers Armozel, Oroiael, Daveithe, Eleleth, and you man-of-light, immortal
aeon Pigera-Adamas, and you good god of the beneficent worlds, Mirocheirothetou,
through Jesus Christ, the Son of God! This is the one whom I proclaim,
inasmuch as there has visited the One who truly exists, among those who
exist [...] do(es) not exist, Abel Baruch - that you (sg.) might be given
the knowledge of the truth [...], that he is from the race of the High-priest,
which is above thousands of thousands, and myriads of myriads, of the aeons.
The adverse spirits are ignorant of him, and (of) their (own) destruction.
Not only (that, but) I have come to reveal to you the truth, which is within
the brethren. He included himself in the living offering, together with
your offspring. He offered them up as an offering to the All. For it is
not cattle that you will offer up for sin(s) of unbelief, and for the ignorances,
and (for) all the wicked deeds which they will do [...]. And they do not
reach the Father of the All [...] the faith ...
<br><i>... (20 lines unrecoverable)</i></blockquote>

<blockquote>For the waters which are above [...] that receive baptism [...].
But receive that baptism which is with the water which [...], while he
is coming ...
<br><i>... (3 lines unrecoverable)</i>
<br>... baptism as they ...
<br><i>... (18 lines unrecoverable)</i>
<br>... pray for the offspring of the archons and all the angels, together
with the seed &lt;which&gt; flowed forth from the Father of the All [...]
the entire [...] from [...] there were engendered the gods and the angels,
and the men [...] out of the seed, all of the natures, those in the heavens
and those upon the earth and those under the earth ...
<br><i>... (14 lines unrecoverable)</i>
<br>... nature of the females [...], among those that are in the [...].
They were bound with [...] But this is not (the) true Adam nor (the) true
Eve.</blockquote>

<blockquote>For when they ate of the tree of knowledge, they trampled the
Cherubim and the Seraphim with the flaming sword. They [...], which was
Adam's, [...] the world-rulers, and [...] them out [...] after they had
brought forth [...] offspring of the archons and their worldly things,
these belonging to ...
<br><i>... (13 lines unrecoverable)</i>
<br>... light [...]. And the females and the males, those who exist with
[...] hidden from every nature, and they will renounce the archons [...]
who receive from him the [...]. For they are worthy of [...] immortal,
and great [...], and great [...], and great [...] sons of men [...] disciples
[...] image, and [...] from the light [...] which is holy. For [...] from
the beginning [...] a seed ...
<br><i>... (lines 13-eop unrecoverable)</i></blockquote>

<blockquote>But I will be silent [...], for we are the brethren who came
down from the living [...]. They will [...] upon the ...
<br><i>... (1 line unrecoverable)</i>
<br>... of Adam, [...], Abel, Enoch, Noah, [...] you, Melchizedek, the
Priest of God Most High, [...] those who [...] women ...
<br><i>... (lines 14-eop unrecoverable)</i>
<br>... these two who have been chosen will at no time nor in any place
will they be convicted, whenever they have been begotten, by their enemies,
by their friends, nor by strangers, nor their (own) kin, (nor) by the impious,
nor the pious. All of the adverse natures will [...] them, whether those
that are manifest, or those that are not manifest, together with those
that dwell in the heavens, and those that are upon the earth, and those
that are under the earth. They will make war [...] every one. For [...],
whether in the ...
<br><i>... (3 lines unrecoverable)</i>
<br>... many ...
<br><i>... (2 lines unrecoverable)</i>
<br>And these in the [...] every one will [...]. These will [...] with
every blow [...] weaknesses. These will be confined in other forms, and
will be punished. These the Savior will take them away, and they will overcome
everything, not with their mouths and words, but by means of the [...],
which will be done for them. He will destroy Death.</blockquote>

<blockquote>These things which I was commanded to reveal, these things
reveal as I (have done). But that which is hidden, do not reveal to anyone,
unless it is revealed to you (to do so).&quot;</blockquote>

<blockquote>And immediately, I arose, I, Melchizedek, and I began to [...]
God [...] that I should rejoice ...
<br><i>... (1 line unrecoverable)</i>
<br>... while he is acting [...] living [...] I said, &quot;I ...
<br><i>... (2 lines unrecoverable)</i>
<br>... and I will not cease, from now on, forever, O Father of the All,
because you have had pity on men, and you have sent the angel of light
[...] from your aeons [...] to reveal [...]. When he came, he caused me
to be raised up from ignorance, and (from) the fructification of death
to life. For I have a name: I am Melchizedek, the Priest of God Most High;
I know that it is I who am truly the image of the true High-Priest of God
Most High, and [...] the world. For it is not a small thing that God [...]
with [...] while he [...]. And [...] the angels that dwell upon the earth
...
<br><i>... (2 lines unrecoverable)</i>
<br>... is the sacrifice of [...], whom Death deceived. When he died, he
bound them with the natures which are leading them astray. Yet he offered
up offerings [...] cattle, saying, &quot;I gave them to Death, and the angels,
and the [...] demons [...] living offering [...]. I have offered up myself
to you as an offering, together with those that are mine, to you yourself,
(O) Father of the All, and those whom you love, who have come forth from
you who are holy (and) living. And &lt;according to&gt; the perfect laws,
I shall pronounce my name as I receive baptism now (and) forever, (as a
name) among the living (and) holy names, and (now) in the waters. Amen.&quot;</blockquote>

who truly exists, [...] do(es) not exist, Abel Baruch [...], for ever and
ever, Amen.</blockquote>
