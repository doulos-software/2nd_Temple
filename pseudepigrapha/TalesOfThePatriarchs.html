<h3>Paraphrase and comments by Lesley Faulk and Amanda Scott</h3>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
	The "Tales of the Patriarchs," which deals with the 
descendants of Adam, is sometimes referred to as the "Genesis 
Apocryphon." Originally, the <cite>Genesis Apocryphon</cite> 
was referred to as the fourth scroll because it was the 
fourth scroll out of seven to be found in the Qumran Cave. 
This "Dead Sea Scroll" was originally thought to have come 
from the apocryphal book of Enoch because a small portion of 
the scroll that had been unraveled, mentioned Enoch's 
name(Fitzmeyer, pg. 4). However, when another section was 
unraveled, scholars were lead to believe that this scroll 
came from the apocryphal book of Lamech, a name that was already 
known to scholars because of the book <cite>Jubilees</cite>. 
The reason why they thought this scroll came from the 
book of Lamech is because the speaker spoke about 
Bitenosh, Lamech's wife, in first person (Yadin, pg. 144). 
Yet once again, this belief was wrong. When the scroll was 
finally fully unraveled, it had references to Noah, Abraham 
and Lot, making the scrolls relation to the 
<cite>Jubilees</cite> more apparent. In many senses one can 
refer to this text as a "Little Genesis" because its 
literary dependence on Genesis is similar to that of the 
<cite>Jubilees</cite> (Fitzmeyer, pg. 4).<p>
	When Avigad and Yadin published the fourth scroll, they 
realized that they could no longer call it the "Book of 
Lamech" and so they decided on the title <cite>Genesis 
Apocryphon</cite> to avoid any further commitments to the 
character of the writing contained in the scroll. Avigad 
stated that "these stories are based on the biblical 
narratives but they also deal with other subjects and 
details previously unknown" (Fitzmeyer, pg. 5). An example 
of this is in of the story of Joseph and Sarah and their 
time in Egypt. In column 20 of the Apocryphon, the time 
duration of Sarah living with the Pharaoh is given as two 
years unlike the bible when a time frame was not given 
(Yadin, pg. 144). Also, the purity of Sarah which was in 
question in the bible is maintained in the <cite>Genesis 
Apocryphon</cite>. Sarah could not have relations with the 
Pharaoh because the evil spirit that Joseph prayed for to 
God made all the men in Egypt impotent. Thus, the purity of 
Adam descendants were maintained (WAC, pg. 74).<p>
	However, not all scholars agreed with this title 
Apocryphon because as R. Meyers believes, "it evokes its 
counterpart, a canonical book, and consequently introduces 
not the Qumran literature a slight anachronism." Yet, even 
with some criticism, the fourth scroll is known as the 
Genesis Apocryphon.<p>
	Now that the debate of naming this scroll was over, the 
task of placing this text into a genre began. It has already 
been stated that this text relies heavily on the canonical 
Genesis, however, this scroll contains additional details 
that were obviously derived from some non-biblical sources. 
For instance, Gn 5.28-29 in the bible is the starting point 
for the extended narrative for columns 2-5 which are 
embellishments of the birth of Noah. Columns 6-17 deals with 
Noah, the flood, and the division of the earth between his 
sons. These lines can once again be compared to the Jubilees 
chapters 4-9. In column 18 and 19 where the narrative has 
shifted to Abraham. This text is the expanded version 
corresponds with of Gn 11.27-14. There is an obvious 
similarity between the working of this section to the 
Jubilees. In column 22, a less direct translation can be 
seen, with the author reverting to the free reworking of the 
Genesis story which has been seen in previous columns, yet 
not returning to the first person except for conversation 
itself (Fitzmeyer, pg. 6).

<h4>Frag.1 Col. 1</h4>
You should let your anger and tear out (?)... and who is the

<h4>Col. 2.<small><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></small></h4>
I thought, in my heart, that the conception was the work of 
the Watchers the pregnancy of the Holy Ones and that it 
belonged to the Giants<a href="#fn2">[2]</a>... and my heart 
was upset by this... I, Lamech, turned to my wife Bitenosh 
and said... Swear to me by the Most High, Great Lord, King 
of the Universe<a href="#fn3">[3]</a>...the sons of heavens, 
that you will truthfully tell me everything, if... You will 
tell me without lies... Then Bitenosh, my wife spoke harshly 
and she cried... and said: Oh my brother and lord! Remember 
my pleasure... the time of love, gasping for breath. I will 
tell you everything truthfully... and then my heart began to 
ache... When Bitenosh realized my mood had changed...Then 
she withheld her anger and said to me: O my lord and 
brother! Remember my pleasure. I swear to you by the Great 
Holy One, the King of the heavens... That this seed, 
pregnancy, and planting of fruit comes from you and not a 
stranger, Watcher, or son of the heaven... Why is your 
expression changed and your spirit saddened... I speak 
honestly to you... Then I, Lamech, went to my father, 
Methuselah, and told him everything so that he would know 
the truth because he is well liked... and he is in well with 
the Holy Ones and they share everything with him. Methuselah 
went to Enoch to find the truth... he will. And he went to 
Parvaim, where Enoch lived... He said to Enoch: O my father 
and lord, to whom I... I tell you! Do not be angry because I 
came here to you... fear before you...

<h4>Col 3</h4>
For in the days of Jared, my father...<a href="#fn4">[4]</a>

<h4>Col 5</h4>
Enoch...not from the sons of heaven, but from Lamech your 
son... I now tell you... and I reveal to you... Go tell your 
son Lamech... When Methuselah heard this... And with his son 
Lamech, he spoke... Now when I, Lamech, heard these 
things... Which he got out of me 

<h4>Col 6<small><a href="#fn5">[5]</a></small></h4>
I abstained from injustice and in the womb of my mother who 
conceived me I searched for truth. When I emerged from my 
mother's womb, I lived all my days in truth and walked in 
the path of eternal truth. And the Holy One was with me... 
on my pathways truth sped to warn me off the... of lie which 
led to darkness.. I braced my loins with the vision of truth 
and wisdom... paths of violence. <em>vacat</em> Then, I Noah 
became a man that clung to truth and seized... I took 
Amzara, his daughter as my wife. She conceived and bore me 
three sons and daughters. I Then took wives from my 
brother's family for my sons, and I gave my daughters to my 
nephews according to the law of the eternal precept which 
Most High ordained to the sons of man. <em>vacat</em> And in 
my days, when according to my reckoning... ten jubilees had 
been completed, the time came for my sons to take wives for 
themselves... heaven, I saw in a vision and was explained 
and made known the actions of the sons of heaven and... the 
heavens. Then I hid this mystery in my heart and explained 
it to no one. <em>vacat</em>... to me and a great and... and 
in a message of the Holy One... and he spoke to me in a 
vision and he stood before me... and the message of the 
Great Holy One called out to me: "To you they say, O' 
Noah,..." and I reckoned the whole conduct of the sons of 
the earth. I knew and explained everything... two weeks. 
then the blood which the Giants had spilled... I was at ease 
and waited until... the holy ones with the daughters of 
man... The I Noah, found grace, greatness and for my entire 
life I have behaved righteously...I, Noah, a man...

<h4>Col. 7</h4>
God told Noah that he would rule over the earth and the seas 
and all they encompass. Noah was overjoyed at the idea.

<h4>Col. 10</h4>
The arc rested upon the mountain of Ararat (Hurarat). Noah 
atoned for the land and burned incense on the alter<a 
href="#fn6">[6]</a>.

<h4>Col. 11</h4>
God makes a covenant with Noah telling him he could no 
longer eat blood of any kind.

<h4>Col. 12</h4>
I placed my bow in the cloud and it became a sign for me in 
the cloud... the earth... it was revealed to me in the 
mountains<a href="#fn7">[7]</a>... a vineyard in the 
mountains of Ararat... After the flood Noah and his sons 
descended from the mountain. They saw the widespread 
devastation of the earth. After the flood Noah's children 
began to have his grandchildren-Sons ands daughters<a 
href="#fn8">[8]</a>. They then planted the soil and put a 
vineyard on Mount Lubar that produced wine four years later: 
On the first day of the fifth year, there was a feast at 
which the first wine was drank. Noah gathered his family 
together and they went to the alter and thanked god for 
saving them from the destruction of the flood.

<h4>Col 13<small><a href="#fn9">[9]</a></small></h4>
...They were cutting gold, silver, stones, and clay and 
taking some for themselves. I saw the gold and silver... 
iron, and they cut down all the trees and took some. I saw 
the sun, moon, and stars cutting and taking some for 
themselves... I turned to see the olive tree and behold, it 
was rising up and for many hours... many leaves... appeared 
in them. I watched the olive tree and the abundance of its 
leaves... they tied to it. I was greatly amazed by the tree 
and its leaves... the four winds of heaven were strongly 
blowing and they were breaking off and smashing the branches 
of the olive tree. The westerly wind hit first, knocking off 
its fruit and leaves and scattering them everywhere. Then... 

<h4>Col 14</h4>
...Listen and hear! You are the great cedar... standing in 
front of you in a dream on the mountain tops... truth. The 
willow that springs from it and rises high (these are) three 
sons... And the one that you did see, the first willow got 
attached to the stump of the cedar... and the wood from 
it... will never separate from you. And among it 
posterity... will be called... will grow a wonderful 
plant... will stand forever. And what you saw, the willow 
caught the stump... the last willow... part of their branch 
entered<a href="#fn10">[10]</a> the branch of the first 
tree, two sons... And what you saw, that part of their 
branch entered the branch of the first tree... I explained 
to him the mystery...

<h4>Col 15</h4>
...And that you saw all of them... They will go around, the 
majority of them will be evil. and what you saw, that a man 
came from the south, with a sickle in his hand, and bringing 
fire with him... who will come from the south of the land... 
And they will put wickedness on the fire, a;;... And he 
should come between... Four angels... between all nations. 
And they will all worship and be dumbfounded... I will 
honestly explain to you. And I, Noah woke up from my sleep 
and the Sun<a href="#fn11">[11]</a>. 


<h4>Col. 16</h4>
Noah divided the land among his decedents.... all the land 
of the north as far as... this boundary, the waters of the 
Mediterranean.... the Tina River.

<h4>Col. 17</h4>
Noah further divided the land West, to Asshur, as far as the 
Tigris. He gave Aram land as far as the source of.... this 
Mountain of the Bull, and he crossed it westward as far 
as.... where the three parts met.... For Arpachshad<a 
href="#fn12">[12]</a>... He gave Gomer<a 
href="#fn13">[13]</a> a part in the northeast t the Tina 
River.... To Magog<a href="#fn14">[14]</a>...



<h4>Col. 19</h4>
I, Abraham built and alter (at Bethel) and called to god, 
praising him. I then went to the Holy mountain and to 
Hebron<a href="#fn15">[15]</a> where he lived for two years. 
Because there was famine in the land my family and I 
traveled to Egypt where grain was plentiful. I went across 
the branches of the Nile<a href="#fn16">[16]</a> to enter 
Egypt, the land of the sons of Ham. I had a dream about a 
cedar tree and a date-palm tree. When people came to cut 
down the cedar tree, the date-palm tree objected, saying 
that they were grown from a single root. The cedar tree was 
spared. I became fearful of the dream and told it to my 
wife. I explained it as it pertained to us telling Sarah 
that the men will come for her and try to kill me. I warned 
Sarah that she must tell everyone that I am her brother so 
that my life can be spared. She became scared and did not 
want to go to Zoan for fear of being seen. Five years 
later<a href="#fn17">[17]</a>, councilors of the Egyptians 
court and advisors of the Pharaoh of Zoan<a 
href="#fn18">[18]</a> came, having heard the words of my 
wife. They brought gifts and requested knowledge from me. I 
read to them from the Book of the words of Enoch. 

<h4>Col. 20<small><a href="#fn19">[19]</a></small></h4>
The men return to the Pharaoh and describe Sarah's features: 
beautiful face, supple hair, lovely eyes, pleasant nose, 
radiant face<a href="#fn20">[20]</a>. He continued on 
describing her shapely breasts, perfect hands, and 
everything down to her long and delicate fingers. the men 
compared her to and rated her far higher than virgins and 
birds, and all other women alike. Hearing this, and then 
seeing Sarah, the pharaoh wanted her and took her for his 
wife. Sarah saved me by telling the pharaoh that I was her 
brother and that night I and my nephew Lot cried together I 
prayed to Lord for justice<a href="#fn21">[21]</a>. I wanted 
the Lord to raise up against the pharaoh and protect Sarah. 
God listened and sent an evil spirit to the entire household 
that prevented the pharaoh from having sexual relations with 
Sarah for the two years that they were together. At the end 
of the two years, the plagues and afflictions were so great 
that magicians and healers were sent for. They were, of 
course, ineffective, and they all soon left. Hyrcanos went 
to me pleading for help against the plague because I had 
been seen in a dream. I agreed to help only when my wife 
Sarah is returned to me. The pharaoh heard this and 
confronted me, himself asking why I lied saying that Sarah 
was my sister. He agreed to give Sarah back and I exorcised 
the evil spirit from the house of the pharaoh. The pharaoh 
swore to me that he had not touched Sarah while they were 
together and gave her gifts of gold, silver, linen, and 
purple-dyed clothing. Sarah and I were then led out of 
Egypt. I, Sarah, Lot, and his wife took our flocks and the 
gold and silver I had received<a href="#fn22">[22]</a> and 
traveled together.

<h4>Col. 21</h4>
I went to all my old campsites until I reached Bethel, the 
place where I once built an alter, and then I built another 
one and offered up burnt offerings and a cereal offerings to 
the God Of Most High, and invoked the name of the Lord of 
the Universe there. I praised God's name and blessed god and 
gave thanks to Him there for all the flocks and goods and 
wealth which he has given me, for the good he has done for 
me, and because He had returned me to this land safely.<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After this day, Lot left me on 
the account of our shepherd's behavior. He went to live in 
the Valley of Jordan taking all his flocks with him. And I 
also added greatly to what he had. he pastured his flock and 
kept moving until he reached Sodom<a href="#fn23">[23]</a> 
and bought a house there, while I still lived in the 
mountain of Bethel. It bothered me that Lot and I had 
separated.<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God came to me in a dream and 
said to me: Go up to Ramat Hazor<a href="#fn24">[24]</a> 
which is north of Bethel, the place you are living now, and 
look to the east, west, south and to the north. Look at the 
land which I am giving you and your descendants forever. The 
next morning I went up to Ramat Hazor and looked at the land 
from that height, from the river of Egypt up to Lebanon and 
Senir<a href="#fn25">[25]</a>, and from the Great Sea up to 
Hauran<a href="#fn26">[26]</a>, and all the land of Gebel<a 
href="#fn27">[27]</a> to Qadesh<a href="#fn28">[28]</a>, and 
all the Great Desert<a href="#fn29">[29]</a>, as far as the 
Euphrates and he said to me: I shall give all this land to 
your descendants; and they will inherit it forever. I will 
multiply your descendants like the dust of the earth that 
none can count. Your descendants will be numberless. Arise, 
walk about, go "see how long and how wide it is, for I will 
give it to you and to your descendants after you, 
forever.<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then I, Abraham, went out 
traveling in a circuit to survey the land. I began the 
circuit at the Gihion River<a href="#fn30">[30]</a>, I went 
along the Mediterranean Sea until I reached the Mountain of 
the Bull<a href="#fn31">[31]</a>. I circled from the coast 
of this great river saltwater sea, skirting the Mount of the 
Bull, and continued eastward through the breadth of the and 
until I came to the Euphrates river. I traveled along the 
Euphrates until I reached the red sea in the east, whence I 
followed the coast of the Red Sea until I came to the branch 
of the Reed Sea<a href="#fn32">[32]</a>, jutting out from 
the Red Sea. From there I completed the circuit, moving 
southward to arrive at Gihon River. Then I returned home 
safely and found all is well with my men. Then I went and 
settled next to the oaks of Mamre<a href="#fn33">[33]</a>, 
which is northeast of Hebron. There I built an alter and 
offered up burnt offering and a cereal offering to the God 
Most High. I ate and drank there, I and all the men of my 
household, and invited Mamre, Arnem, and Eshkol, three 
Amorite brothers and my friends. They ate and drank together 
with me. Prior to those days Chedorlaomer, the king of Elam, 
Amraphel, the king of Babylon, Arioch, the king of 
Cappadocia<a href="#fn34">[34]</a>, and Tidal, the king of 
Goiim<a href="#fn35">[35]</a>, which lies between the two 
rivers had come. They had waged war on Bera, the king of 
Sodom, Birsha, the king of Gomorrah, Shinab, the king of 
Admah, Shemiabad, the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela. 
All these formed an alliance to do battle in the Valley of 
Siddim. Now the king of Elam, and the kings with him proved 
to be stronger than the king of Sodom and imposed tribute 
upon them. Over twelve years they continued paying their 
tribute to the king of Elam, but in the thirteenth they 
rebelled against him. Thus the fourteenth year the king of 
Elam sallied forth with all his allies, and they ascended by 
the way of the desert<a href="#fn36">[36]</a>. They smote and 
plundered beginning from the Euphrates. They kept on 
smiting-smiting the Rephaim who were in the Asteroth-
Kernaim<a href="#fn37">[37]</a>, the Zumzammin who were 
Amman, the Emim<a href="#fn">[38]</a> who were in Shaveh-
hakerioth, and the Horites who were in the mountain of 
Gebal-until they reached El- Paran, in the desert. They 
returned...in Hazazon-tamar<a href="#fn39">[39]</a>. The 
king of Sodom went out to meet him, together with the king 
of Gomorrah, Admah, Zeboiim and the king of Bela. They 
engaged in battle in the valley of Siddim against 
Chedorlaomer, and allies that were with him. The king of 
Sodom was defeated and put to flight while the king of 
Gomorrah fell into the pits... The king Elam plundered all 
the property of Sodom and of Gomorrah and they captured Lot.

<h2>Footnotes</h2>

<a name="fn1">[1]</a> The columns numbers differ between sources.  
This is because recent research has shown that the 1Q20 fragments 
comprise column 1 and 2 but are not after included with this 
work.<br>
<a name="fn2">[2]</a> Lamech believes that his wife Bitenosh has 
been with fallen angels called Watchers or Nephilim.  He fears 
his child may be a Giant because of this union with the Watcher.<br>
<a name="fn3">[3]</a> Most High, Great Lord, King of the Universe 
are all referring to God; the names make God appear even more 
powerful and mighty.<br>
<a name="fn4">[4]</a> This column contains the beginning of 
Enoch's reply to Methuselah.  He starts talking about how in the 
days of Jared, angels descended to take human wives.<br>
<a name="fn5">[5]</a> There are  very few sources where this 
column's context is explained.  Many  sources attempt  to 
hypothesize what the text is trying to get across but an 
agreement has yet to be established.  The main thrust of this 
text is that Noah, after being born with  the  gift of knowing 
the truth, lived his life righteously, married, and married his 
children off.  Finally this passage ends with Noah having a 
vision. <br>
<a name="fn6">[6]</a> These are the activities that occur 
immediately after the flood.<br>
<a name="fn7">[7]</a> Mountain of Ararat<br>
<a name="fn8">[8]</a> Noah's grandsons were Arpachsad, Gomer, 
Magog, Madai, Yavan, Tubal, Mosok, and Tiras.  Others were born, 
as well as granddaughters, but their names are not mentioned.<br>
<a name="fn9">[9]</a> This column is not found in many sources 
and no explanations are given beyond the text.  It is unclear who 
"they" and the significance of the olive tree.  Columns 14 and 15 
also have no further explanation.<br>
<a name="fn10">[10]</a> Part of the branch possibly got entangled 
with<br>
<a name="fn11">[11]</a> This passage presents the idea that Noah 
had been dreaming in columns 13,14,15 after he came down from the 
mountain.<br>

<a name="fn15">[15]</a> In the bible it only states that Abraham 
set out, continuing on his way to Negeb with no mention of 
Hebron.  Hebron is a town older than any other in the country- 
approximately 2300 years old.<br>
<a name="fn16">[16]</a> Carmon is the branch mentioned but it is 
controversial whether the translation from Greek gives an actual 
branch of the Nile or not.<br>
<a name="fn17">[17]</a> As with all Biblical writings, the 
mention of time periods is controversial.  five years is not an 
exact time period.<br>
<a name="fn18">[18]</a> Zoan is the old Testament name for Tanis, 
a town in Egypt.<br>
<a name="fn19">[19]</a> The descriptions of Sarah's beauty 
provide many details that writers of the scroll believed were 
locking in the Old Testament.<br>
<a name="fn20">[20]</a> This can be literally taken as "all the 
bloom" of her face.  It suggests Sarah's god given beauty that 
cannot be taken away.<br>
<a name="fn21">[21]</a> Biblical accounts do not include 
Abraham's praying to God.<br>
<a name="fn22">[22]</a> This is actually interpreted incorrectly.  
The gifts were given to Sarah by the Pharaoh, and Abraham's 
wealth was independent of these gifts.<br>

unfortunately, no other information is given.<br>

of Judea, which gives Abraham an unique view of the land.<br>

the Anti-Lebanon range. <br>
<a name="fn26">[26]</a>  it is a broad,  high plateau that is 
southeast of Mt. Hermon..<br>

called Mount Amanus, situated north of Alexandretta. <br>
<a name="fn32">[32]</a> Tongue-shaped gulf of the Suez.<br>
