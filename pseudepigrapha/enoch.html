        <FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">2.</FONT> And I saw the corner-stone of the earth: I saw the four winds which bear <FONT Color="#882222" Size="-1">[the earth and]</FONT> the firmament of the <A Href="http://scriptures.lds.org/bdh/heaven">heaven</A>. 
        <FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">3.</FONT> And I saw how the winds stretch out the vaults of <A Href="http://scriptures.lds.org/bdh/heaven">heaven</A>, and have their station between <A Href="http://scriptures.lds.org/bdh/heaven">heaven</A> and earth: these are the pillars of the <A Href="http://scriptures.lds.org/bdh/heaven">heaven</A>. 
        <FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">4.</FONT> I saw the winds of <A Href="http://scriptures.lds.org/bdh/heaven">heaven</A> which turn and bring the circumference of the sun and all the stars to their setting. 
        <FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">5.</FONT> I saw the winds on the earth carrying the clouds: I saw the paths of the <A Href="http://scriptures.lds.org/bda/angels">angels</A>. I saw at the end of the earth the firmament of the <A Href="http://scriptures.lds.org/bdh/heaven">heaven</A> above. 
        <FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">6.</FONT> And I proceeded and saw a place which burns day and night, where there are seven mountains of magnificent stones, three towards the east, and three towards the south. 
        <FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">7.</FONT> And as for those towards the east, <ONE>was of coloured stone, and one of pearl, and one of jacinth, and those towards the south of red stone. 
        <FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">8.</FONT> But the middle one reached to <A Href="http://scriptures.lds.org/bdh/heaven">heaven</A> like the throne of <A Href="http://scriptures.lds.org/bdg/god">God</A>, of alabaster, and the summit of the throne was of sapphire. 
        <FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">9.</FONT> And I saw a flaming fire. 
        <FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">10.</FONT> And beyond these mountains Is a region the end of the great earth: there the heavens were completed. 
        <FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">11.</FONT> And I saw a deep abyss, with columns of heavenly fire, and among them I saw columns of fire fall, which were beyond measure alike towards the height and towards the depth. 
        <FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">12.</FONT> And beyond that abyss I saw a place which had no firmament of the <A Href="http://scriptures.lds.org/bdh/heaven">heaven</A> above, and no firmly founded earth beneath it: there was no water upon it, and no birds, but it was a waste and horrible place. 
        <FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">13.</FONT> I saw there seven stars like great burning mountains, and to me, when I inquired regarding them, 
        <FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">14.</FONT> The angel said: 'This place is the end of <A Href="http://scriptures.lds.org/bdh/heaven">heaven</A> and earth: this has become a prison for the stars and the host of <A Href="http://scriptures.lds.org/bdh/heaven">heaven</A>. 
        <FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">15.</FONT> And the stars which roll over the fire are they which have transgressed the commandment of the <A Href="http://scriptures.lds.org/bdl/lord">Lord</A> in the beginning of their rising, because they did not come forth at their appointed times. 
        <FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">16.</FONT> And He was wroth with them, and bound them till the time when their guilt should be consummated <FONT Color="#228822" Size="-1">(even)</FONT> for ten thousand years.'

        <FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">2.</FONT> And there I saw the mansions of the elect and the mansions of the holy, and mine eyes saw there all the sinners being driven from thence which deny the name of the <A Href="http://scriptures.lds.org/bdl/lord">Lord</A> of Spirits, and being dragged off: and they could not abide because of the punishment which proceeds from the <A Href="http://scriptures.lds.org/bdl/lord">Lord</A> of Spirits. 
        <FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">3.</FONT> And there mine eyes saw the secrets of the lightning and of the thunder, and the secrets of the winds, how they are divided to blow over the earth, and the secrets of the clouds and dew, and there I saw from whence they proceed in that place and from whence they saturate the dusty earth. 
        <FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">4.</FONT> And there I saw closed chambers out of which the winds are divided, the chamber of the hail and winds, the chamber of the mist, and of the clouds, and the cloud thereof hovers over the earth from the beginning of the world. 
        <FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">5.</FONT> And I saw the chambers of the sun and moon, whence they proceed and whither they come again, and their glorious return, and how one is superior to the other, and their stately orbit, and how they do not leave their orbit, and they add nothing to their orbit and they take nothing from it, and they keep faith with each other, in accordance with the oath by which they are bound together. 
        <FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">6.</FONT> And first the sun goes forth and traverses his path according to the commandment of the <A Href="http://scriptures.lds.org/bdl/lord">Lord</A> of Spirits, and mighty is His name for ever and ever. 
        <FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">7.</FONT> And after that I saw the hidden and the visible path of the moon, and she accomplishes the course of her path in that place by day and by night-the one holding a position opposite to the other before the <A Href="http://scriptures.lds.org/bdl/lord">Lord</A> of Spirits. <P>And they give thanks and praise and rest not;<BR>For unto them is their thanksgiving rest.
    <BR><FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">8.</FONT> For the sun changes oft for a blessing or a curse,<BR>And the course of the path of the moon is light to the righteous<BR>And darkness to the sinners in the name of the <A Href="http://scriptures.lds.org/bdl/lord">Lord</A>,<BR>Who made a separation between the light and the darkness,<BR>And divided the <A Href="http://scriptures.lds.org/bds/spirit">spirits</A> of men,<BR>And strengthened the <A Href="http://scriptures.lds.org/bds/spirit">spirits</A> of the righteous,<BR>In the name of His righteousness.

     <P><FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">1.</FONT> The book of the courses of the luminaries of the <A Href="http://scriptures.lds.org/bdh/heaven">heaven</A>, the relations of each, according to their classes, their dominion and their seasons, according to their names and places of origin, and according to their months, which Uriel, the holy angel, who was with me, who is their guide, showed me; and he showed me all their laws exactly as they are, and how it is with regard to all the years of the world and unto eternity, till the new creation is accomplished which dureth till eternity. 
        <FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">2.</FONT> And this is the first law of the luminaries: the luminary the Sun has its rising in the eastern portals of the <A Href="http://scriptures.lds.org/bdh/heaven">heaven</A>, and its setting in the western portals of the <A Href="http://scriptures.lds.org/bdh/heaven">heaven</A>. 
        <FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">3.</FONT> And I saw six portals in which the sun rises, and six portals in which the sun sets and the moon rises and sets in these portals, and the leaders of the stars and those whom they lead: six in the east and six in the west, and all following each other in accurately corresponding order: also many windows to the right and left of these portals. 
        <FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">4.</FONT> And first there goes forth the great luminary, named the Sun, and his circumference is like the circumference of the <A Href="http://scriptures.lds.org/bdh/heaven">heaven</A>, and he is quite filled with illuminating and heating fire. 
        <FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">5.</FONT> The chariot on which he ascends, the wind drives, and the sun goes down from the <A Href="http://scriptures.lds.org/bdh/heaven">heaven</A> and returns through the north in order to reach the east, and is so guided that he comes to the appropriate <FONT Color="#228822" Size="-1">(lit. ' that ')</FONT> portal and shines in the face of the <A Href="http://scriptures.lds.org/bdh/heaven">heaven</A>. 
        <FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">6.</FONT> In this way he rises in the first month in the great portal, which is the fourth <FONT Color="#882222" Size="-1">[those six portals in the cast]</FONT>. 
        <FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">7.</FONT> And in that fourth portal from which the sun rises in the first month are twelve window-openings, from which proceed a flame when they are opened in their season. 
        <FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">8.</FONT> When the sun rises in the <A Href="http://scriptures.lds.org/bdh/heaven">heaven</A>, he comes forth through that fourth portal thirty, mornings in succession, and sets accurately in the fourth portal in the west of the <A Href="http://scriptures.lds.org/bdh/heaven">heaven</A>. 
        <FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">9.</FONT> And during this period the day becomes daily longer and the night nightly shorter to the thirtieth morning. 
        <FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">10.</FONT> On that day the day is longer than the night by a ninth part, and the day amounts exactly to ten parts and the night to eight parts. 
        <FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">11.</FONT> And the sun rises from that fourth portal, and sets in the fourth and returns to the fifth portal of the east thirty mornings, and rises from it and sets in the fifth portal. 
        <FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">12.</FONT> And then the day becomes longer by two parts and amounts to eleven parts, and the night becomes shorter and amounts to seven parts. 
        <FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">13.</FONT> And it returns to the east and enters into the sixth portal, and rises and sets in the sixth portal one-and-thirty mornings on account of its sign. 
        <FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">14.</FONT> On that day the day becomes longer than the night, and the day becomes double the night, and the day becomes twelve parts, and the night is shortened and becomes six parts. 
        <FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">15.</FONT> And the sun mounts up to make the day shorter and the night longer, and the sun returns to the east and enters into the sixth portal, and rises from it and sets thirty mornings. 
        <FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">16.</FONT> And when thirty mornings are accomplished, the day decreases by exactly one part, and becomes eleven parts, and the night seven. 
        <FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">17.</FONT> And the sun goes forth from that sixth portal in the west, and goes to the east and rises in the fifth portal for thirty mornings, and sets in the west again in the fifth western portal. 
        <FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">18.</FONT> On that day the day decreases by two parts, and amounts to ten parts and the night to eight parts. 
        <FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">19.</FONT> And the sun goes forth from that fifth portal and sets in the fifth portal of the west, and rises in the fourth portal for one- and-thirty mornings on account of its sign, and sets in the west. 
        <FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">20.</FONT> On that day the day is equalized with the night, <FONT Color="#882222" Size="-1">[and becomes of equal length]</FONT>, and the night amounts to nine parts and the day to nine parts. 
        <FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">21.</FONT> And the sun rises from that portal and sets in the west, and returns to the east and rises thirty mornings in the third portal and sets in the west in the third portal. 
        <FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">22.</FONT> And on that day the night becomes longer than the day, and night becomes longer than night, and day shorter than day till the thirtieth morning, and the night amounts exactly to ten parts and the day to eight parts. 
        <FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">23.</FONT> And the sun rises from that third portal and sets in the third portal in the west and returns to the east, and for thirty mornings rises in the second portal in the east, and in like manner sets in the second portal in the west of the <A Href="http://scriptures.lds.org/bdh/heaven">heaven</A>. 
        <FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">24.</FONT> And on that day the night amounts to eleven parts and the day to seven parts. 
        <FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">25.</FONT> And the sun rises on that day from that second portal and sets in the west in the second portal, and returns to the east into the first portal for one-and-thirty mornings, and sets in the first portal in the west of the <A Href="http://scriptures.lds.org/bdh/heaven">heaven</A>. 
        <FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">26.</FONT> And on that day the night becomes longer and amounts to the double of the day: and the night amounts exactly to twelve parts and the day to six. 
        <FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">27.</FONT> And the sun has <FONT Color="#228822" Size="-1">(therewith)</FONT> traversed the divisions of his orbit and turns again on those divisions of his orbit, and enters that portal thirty mornings and sets also in the west opposite to it. 
        <FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">28.</FONT> And on that night has the night decreased in length by a ninth part, and the night has become eleven parts and the day seven parts. 
        <FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">29.</FONT> And the sun has returned and entered into the second portal in the east, and returns on those his divisions of his orbit for thirty mornings, rising and setting. 
        <FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">30.</FONT> And on that day the night decreases in length, and the night amounts to ten parts and the day to eight. 
        <FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">31.</FONT> And on that day the sun rises from that portal, and sets in the west, and returns to the east, and rises in the third portal for one-and-thirty mornings, and sets in the west of the <A Href="http://scriptures.lds.org/bdh/heaven">heaven</A>. 
        <FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">32.</FONT> On that day the night decreases and amounts to nine parts, and the day to nine parts, and the night is equal to the day and the year is exactly as to its days three hundred and sixty-four. 
        <FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">33.</FONT> And the length of the day and of the night, and the shortness of the day and of the night arise-through the course of the sun these distinctions are made <FONT Color="#228822" Size="-1">(lit. ' they are separated ')</FONT>. 
        <FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">34.</FONT> So it comes that its course becomes daily longer, and its course nightly shorter. 
        <FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">35.</FONT> And this is the law and the course of the sun, and his return as often as he returns sixty times and rises, i.e. the great luminary which is named the sun, for ever and ever. 
        <FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">36.</FONT> And that which <FONT Color="#228822" Size="-1">(thus)</FONT> rises is the great luminary, and is so named according to its appearance, according as the <A Href="http://scriptures.lds.org/bdl/lord">Lord</A> commanded. 
        <FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">37.</FONT> As he rises, so he sets and decreases not, and rests not, but runs day and night, and his light is sevenfold brighter than that of the moon; but as regards size they are both equal.

     <P><FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">1.</FONT> And after this law I saw another law dealing with the smaller luminary, which is named the Moon. 
        <FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">2.</FONT> And her circumference is like the circumference of the <A Href="http://scriptures.lds.org/bdh/heaven">heaven</A>, and her chariot in which she rides is driven by the wind, and light is given to her in <FONT Color="#228822" Size="-1">(definite)</FONT> measure. 
        <FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">3.</FONT> And her rising and setting change every month: and her days are like the days of the sun, and when her light is uniform <FONT Color="#228822" Size="-1">(i.e. full)</FONT> it amounts to the seventh part of the light of the sun. 
        <FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">4.</FONT> And thus she rises. And her first phase in the east comes forth on the thirtieth morning: and on that day she becomes visible, and constitutes for you the first phase of the moon on the thirtieth day together with the sun in the portal where the sun rises. 
        <FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">5.</FONT> And the one half of her goes forth by a seventh part, and her whole circumference is empty, without light, with the exception of one-seventh part of it, <FONT Color="#228822" Size="-1">(and)</FONT> the fourteenth part of her light. 
        <FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">6.</FONT> And when she receives one-seventh part of the half of her light, her light amounts to one-seventh part and the half thereof. 
        <FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">7.</FONT> And she sets with the sun, and when the sun rises the moon rises with him and receives the half of one part of light, and in that night in the beginning of her morning <FONT Color="#882222" Size="-1">[in the commencement of the lunar day]</FONT> the moon sets with the sun, and is invisible that night with the fourteen parts and the half of one of them. 
        <FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">8.</FONT> And she rises on that day with exactly a seventh part, and comes forth and recedes from the rising of the sun, and in her remaining days she becomes bright in the <FONT Color="#228822" Size="-1">(remaining)</FONT> thirteen parts.

     <P><FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">1.</FONT> And I saw another course, a law for her, <FONT Color="#228822" Size="-1">(and)</FONT> how according to that law she performs her monthly revolution. 
        <FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">2.</FONT> And all these Uriel, the holy angel who is the leader of them all, showed to me, and their positions, and I wrote down their positions as he showed them to me, and I wrote down their months as they were, and the appearance of their lights till fifteen days were accomplished. 
        <FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">3.</FONT> In single seventh parts she accomplishes all her light in the east, and in single seventh parts accomplishes all her darkness in the west. 
        <FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">4.</FONT> And in certain months she alters her settings, and in certain months she pursues her own peculiar course. 
        <FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">5.</FONT> In two months the moon sets with the sun: in those two middle portals the third and the fourth. 
        <FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">6.</FONT> She goes forth for seven days, and turns about and returns again through the portal where the sun rises, and accomplishes all her light: and she recedes from the sun, and in eight days enters the sixth portal from which the sun goes forth. 
        <FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">7.</FONT> And when the sun goes forth from the fourth portal she goes forth seven days, until she goes forth from the fifth and turns back again in seven days into the fourth portal and accomplishes all her light: and she recedes and enters into the first portal in eight days. 
        <FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">8.</FONT> And she returns again in seven days into the fourth portal from which the sun goes forth. 
        <FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">9.</FONT> Thus I saw their position -how the moons rose and the sun set in those days. 
        <FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">10.</FONT> And if five years are added together the sun has an overplus of thirty days, and all the days which accrue to it for one of those five years, when they are full, amount to 364 days. 
        <FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">11.</FONT> And the overplus of the sun and of the stars amounts to six days: in 5 years 6 days every year come to 30 days: and the moon falls behind the sun and stars to the number of 30 days. 
        <FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">12.</FONT> And the sun and the stars bring in all the years exactly, so that they do not advance or delay their position by a single day unto eternity; but complete the years with perfect justice in 364 days. 
        <FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">13.</FONT> In 3 years there are 1,092 days, and in 5 years 1,820 days, so that in 8 years there are 2,912 days. 
        <FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">14.</FONT> For the moon alone the days amount in 3 years to 1,062 days, and in 5 years she falls 50 days behind: <FONT Color="#882222" Size="-1">[i.e. to the sum <FONT Color="#228822" Size="-1">(of 1,770)</FONT> there is to be added <FONT Color="#228822" Size="-1">(1,000 and)</FONT> 62 days.]</FONT>

     <P><FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">1.</FONT> And now, my son Methuselah, I will show thee all my visions which I have seen, recounting them before thee. 
        <FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">2.</FONT> Two visions I saw before I took a wife, and the one was quite unlike the other: the first when I was learning to write: the second before I took thy mother, <FONT Color="#228822" Size="-1">(when)</FONT> I saw a terrible vision. And regarding them I prayed to the <A Href="http://scriptures.lds.org/bdl/lord">Lord</A>. 
        <FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">3.</FONT> I had laid me down in the house of my grandfather Mahalalel, <FONT Color="#228822" Size="-1">(when)</FONT> I saw in a vision how the <A Href="http://scriptures.lds.org/bdh/heaven">heaven</A> collapsed and was borne off and fell to 4 the earth. 
        <FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">4.</FONT> And when it fell to the earth I saw how the earth was swallowed up in a great abyss, and mountains were suspended on mountains, and hills sank down on hills, and high trees were rent from their stems, and hurled down and sunk in the abyss. 
        <FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">5.</FONT> And thereupon a word fell into my mouth, 6 and I lifted up <FONT Color="#228822" Size="-1">(my voice)</FONT> to cry aloud, and said: ' The earth is destroyed.' 
        <FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">6.</FONT> And my grandfather Mahalalel waked me as I lay near him, and said unto me: ' Why dost thou cry so, my son, and why dost thou make such lamentation?' 
        <FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">7.</FONT> And I recounted to him the whole vision which I had seen, and he said unto me: ' A terrible thing hast thou seen, my son, and of grave moment is thy dream- vision as to the secrets of all the sin of the earth: it must sink into the abyss and be destroyed with a great destruction. 
        <FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">8.</FONT> And now, my son, arise and make petition to the <A Href="http://scriptures.lds.org/bdl/lord">Lord</A> of glory, since thou art a believer, that a remnant may remain on the earth, and that He may not destroy the whole earth. 
        <FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">9.</FONT> My son, from <A Href="http://scriptures.lds.org/bdh/heaven">heaven</A> all this will come upon the earth, and upon the earth there will be great destruction. 
        <FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">10.</FONT> After that I arose and prayed and implored and besought, and wrote down my prayer for the generations of the world, and I will show everything to thee, my son Methuselah. 
        <FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">11.</FONT> And when I had gone forth below and seen the <A Href="http://scriptures.lds.org/bdh/heaven">heaven</A>, and the sun rising in the east, and the moon setting in the west, and a few stars, and the whole earth, and everything as He had known it in the beginning, then I blessed the <A Href="http://scriptures.lds.org/bdl/lord">Lord</A> of judgement and extolled Him because He had made the sun to go forth from the windows of the east, and he ascended and rose on the face of the <A Href="http://scriptures.lds.org/bdh/heaven">heaven</A>, and set out and kept traversing the path shown unto him.

        <FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">2.</FONT> And again I raised mine eyes towards <A Href="http://scriptures.lds.org/bdh/heaven">heaven</A> and saw a lofty roof, with seven water torrents thereon, and those torrents flowed with much water into an enclosure.

     <P><FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">10.</FONT> And they began to bring forth beasts of the field and birds, so that there arose different genera: lions, tigers, wolves, dogs, hyenas, wild boars, foxes, squirrels, swine, falcons, vultures, kites, eagles, and ravens; and among them was born a white bull. 
        <FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">11.</FONT> And they began to bite one another; but that white bull which was born amongst them begat a wild ass and a white bull with it, and the wild asses multiplied. 
        <FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">12.</FONT> But that bull which was born from him begat a black wild boar and a white sheep; and the former begat many boars, but that sheep begat twelve sheep. 
        <FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">13.</FONT> And when those twelve sheep had grown, they gave up one of them to the asses, and those asses again gave up that sheep to the wolves, and that sheep grew up among the wolves. 
        <FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">14.</FONT> And the <A Href="http://scriptures.lds.org/bdl/lord">Lord</A> brought the eleven sheep to live with it and to pasture with it among the wolves: and they multiplied and became many flocks of sheep. 
        <FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">15.</FONT> And the wolves began to fear them, and they oppressed them until they destroyed their little ones, and they cast their young into a river of much water: but those sheep began to cry aloud on account of their little ones, and to complain unto their <A Href="http://scriptures.lds.org/bdl/lord">Lord</A>. 
        <FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">16.</FONT> And a sheep which had been saved from the wolves fled and escaped to the wild asses; and I saw the sheep how they lamented and cried, and besought their <A Href="http://scriptures.lds.org/bdl/lord">Lord</A> with all their might, till that <A Href="http://scriptures.lds.org/bdl/lord">Lord</A> of the sheep descended at the voice of the sheep from a lofty abode, and came to them and pastured them. 
        <FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">17.</FONT> And He called that sheep which had escaped the wolves, and spake with it concerning the wolves that it should admonish them not to touch the sheep. 
        <FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">18.</FONT> And the sheep went to the wolves according to the word of the <A Href="http://scriptures.lds.org/bdl/lord">Lord</A>, and another sheep met it and went with it, and the two went and entered together into the assembly of those wolves, and spake with them and admonished them not to touch the sheep from henceforth. 
        <FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">19.</FONT> And thereupon I saw the wolves, and how they oppressed the sheep exceedingly with all their power; and the sheep cried aloud. 
        <FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">20.</FONT> And the <A Href="http://scriptures.lds.org/bdl/lord">Lord</A> came to the sheep and they began to smite those wolves: and the wolves began to make lamentation; but the sheep became quiet and forthwith ceased to cry out. 
        <FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">21.</FONT> And I saw the sheep till they departed from amongst the wolves; but the eyes of the wolves were blinded, and those wolves departed in pursuit of the sheep  with all their power. 
        <FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">22.</FONT> And the <A Href="http://scriptures.lds.org/bdl/lord">Lord</A> of the sheep went with them, as their leader, and all His sheep followed Him: and his face was dazzling and glorious and terrible to behold. 
        <FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">23.</FONT> But the wolves began to pursue those sheep till they reached a sea of water. 
        <FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">24.</FONT> And that sea was divided, and the water stood on this side and on that before their face, and their <A Href="http://scriptures.lds.org/bdl/lord">Lord</A> led them and placed Himself between them and the wolves. 
        <FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">25.</FONT> And as those wolves did not yet see the sheep, they proceeded into the midst of that sea, and the wolves followed the sheep, and <FONT Color="#882222" Size="-1">[those wolves]</FONT> ran after them into that sea. 
        <FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">26.</FONT> And when they saw the <A Href="http://scriptures.lds.org/bdl/lord">Lord</A> of the sheep, they turned to flee before His face, but that sea gathered itself together, and became as it had been created, and the water swelled and rose till it covered those wolves. 
        <FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">27.</FONT> And I saw till all the wolves who pursued those sheep perished and were drowned. 
     <P><FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">28.</FONT> But the sheep escaped from that water and went forth into a wilderness, where there was no water and no grass; and they began to open their eyes and to see; and I saw the <A Href="http://scriptures.lds.org/bdl/lord">Lord</A> of the sheep pasturing them and giving them water and grass, and that sheep going and leading them. 
        <FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">29.</FONT> And that sheep ascended to the summit of that lofty rock, and the <A Href="http://scriptures.lds.org/bdl/lord">Lord</A> of the sheep sent it to them. 
        <FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">30.</FONT> And after that I saw the <A Href="http://scriptures.lds.org/bdl/lord">Lord</A> of the sheep who stood before them, and His appearance was great and terrible and majestic, and all those sheep saw Him and were afraid before His face. 
        <FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">31.</FONT> And they all feared and trembled because of Him, and they cried to that sheep with them <FONT Color="#882222" Size="-1">[which was amongst them]</FONT>: ' We are not able to stand before our <A Href="http://scriptures.lds.org/bdl/lord">Lord</A> or to behold Him.' 
        <FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">32.</FONT> And that sheep which led them again ascended to the summit of that rock, but the sheep began to be blinded and to wander from the way which he had showed them, but that sheep wot not thereof. 
        <FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">33.</FONT> And the <A Href="http://scriptures.lds.org/bdl/lord">Lord</A> of the sheep was wrathful exceedingly against them, and that sheep discovered it, and went down from the summit of the rock, and came to the sheep, and found the greatest part of them blinded and fallen away. 
        <FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">34.</FONT> And when they saw it they feared and trembled at its presence, and desired to return to their folds. 
        <FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">35.</FONT> And that sheep took other sheep with it, and came to those sheep which had fallen away, and began to slay them; and the sheep feared its presence, and thus that sheep brought back those sheep that had fallen away, and they returned to their folds. 
        <FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">36.</FONT> And I saw in this vision till that sheep became a man and built a house for the <A Href="http://scriptures.lds.org/bdl/lord">Lord</A> of the sheep, and placed all the sheep in that house. 
        <FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">37.</FONT> And I saw till this sheep which had met that sheep which led them fell asleep: and I saw till all the great sheep perished and little ones arose in their place, and they came to a pasture, and approached a stream of water. 
        <FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">38.</FONT> Then that sheep, their leader which had become a man, withdrew from them and fell asleep, and all the sheep sought it and cried over it with a great crying. 
        <FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">39.</FONT> And I saw till they left off crying for that sheep and crossed that stream of water, and there arose the two sheep as leaders in the place of those which had led them and fallen asleep <FONT Color="#228822" Size="-1">(lit.

        <FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">40.</FONT> And I saw till the sheep came to a goodly place, and a pleasant and glorious land, and I saw till those sheep were satisfied; and that house stood amongst them in the pleasant land. 
     <P><FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">41.</FONT> And sometimes their eyes were opened, and sometimes blinded, till another sheep arose and led them and brought them all back, and their eyes were opened. 
     <P><FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">42.</FONT> And the dogs and the foxes and the wild boars began to devour those sheep till the <A Href="http://scriptures.lds.org/bdl/lord">Lord</A> of the sheep raised up <FONT Color="#882222" Size="-1">[another sheep]</FONT> a ram from their midst, which led them.

        <FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">44.</FONT> And that sheep whose eyes were opened saw that ram, which was amongst the sheep, till it forsook its glory and began to butt those sheep, and trampled upon them, and behaved itself unseemly. 
        <FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">45.</FONT> And the <A Href="http://scriptures.lds.org/bdl/lord">Lord</A> of the sheep sent the lamb to another lamb and raised it to being a ram and leader of the sheep instead of that ram which had forsaken its glory. 
        <FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">46.</FONT> And it went to it and spake to it alone, and raised it to being a ram, and made it the prince and leader of the sheep; but during all these things those dogs oppressed the sheep. 
        <FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">47.</FONT> And the first ram pursued that second ram, and that second ram arose and fled before it; and I saw till those dogs pulled down the first ram. 
        <FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">48.</FONT> And that second ram arose and led the <FONT Color="#882222" Size="-1">[little]</FONT> sheep. 
        <FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">49.</FONT> And those sheep grew and multiplied; but all the dogs, and foxes, and wild boars feared and fled before it, and that ram butted and killed the wild beasts, and those wild beasts had no longer any power among the sheep and robbed them no more of ought. 
        <FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">48b.</FONT> And that ram begat many sheep and fell asleep; and a little sheep became ram in its stead, and became prince and leader of those sheep. 
     <P><FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">50.</FONT> And that house became great and broad, and it was built for those sheep: <FONT Color="#228822" Size="-1">(and)</FONT> a tower lofty and great was built on the house for the <A Href="http://scriptures.lds.org/bdl/lord">Lord</A> of the sheep, and that house was low, but the tower was elevated and lofty, and the <A Href="http://scriptures.lds.org/bdl/lord">Lord</A> of the sheep stood on that tower and they offered a full table before Him. 
     <P><FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">51.</FONT> And again I saw those sheep that they again erred and went many ways, and forsook that their house, and the <A Href="http://scriptures.lds.org/bdl/lord">Lord</A> of the sheep called some from amongst the sheep and sent them to the sheep, but the sheep began to slay them. 
        <FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">52.</FONT> And one of them was saved and was not slain, and it sped away and cried aloud over the sheep; and they sought to slay it, but the <A Href="http://scriptures.lds.org/bdl/lord">Lord</A> of the sheep saved it from the sheep, and brought it up to me, and caused it to dwell there. 
        <FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">53.</FONT> And many other sheep He sent to those sheep to testify unto them and lament over them. 
        <FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">54.</FONT> And after that I saw that when they forsook the house of the <A Href="http://scriptures.lds.org/bdl/lord">Lord</A> and His tower they fell away entirely, and their eyes were blinded; and I saw the <A Href="http://scriptures.lds.org/bdl/lord">Lord</A> of the sheep how He wrought much slaughter amongst them in their herds until those sheep invited that slaughter and betrayed His place. 
        <FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">55.</FONT> And He gave them over into the hands of the lions and tigers, and wolves and hyenas, and into the hand of the foxes, and to all the wild beasts, and those wild beasts began to tear in pieces those sheep. 
        <FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">56.</FONT> And I saw that He forsook that their house and their tower and gave them all into the hand of the lions, to tear and devour them, into the hand of all the wild beasts. 
        <FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">57.</FONT> And I began to cry aloud with all my power, and to appeal to the <A Href="http://scriptures.lds.org/bdl/lord">Lord</A> of the sheep, and to represent to Him in regard to the sheep that they were devoured by all the wild beasts. 
        <FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">58.</FONT> But He remained unmoved, though He saw it, and rejoiced that they were devoured and swallowed and robbed, and left them to be devoured in the hand of all the beasts. 
        <FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">59.</FONT> And He called seventy shepherds, and cast those sheep to them that they might pasture them, and He spake to the shepherds and their companions: ' Let each individual of you pasture the sheep henceforward, and everything that I shall command you that do ye. 
        <FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">60.</FONT> And I will deliver them over unto you duly numbered, and tell you which of them are to be destroyed-and them destroy ye.' 
        <FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">61.</FONT> And He gave over unto them those sheep. And He called another and spake unto him: ' Observe and mark everything that the shepherds will do to those sheep; for they will destroy more of them than I have commanded them. 
        <FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">62.</FONT> And every excess and the destruction which will be wrought through the shepherds, record <FONT Color="#228822" Size="-1">(namely)</FONT> how many they destroy according to my command, and how many according to their own caprice: record against every individual shepherd all the destruction he effects. 
        <FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">63.</FONT> And read out before me by number how many they destroy, and how many they deliver over for destruction, that I may have this as a testimony against them, and know every deed of the shepherds, that I may comprehend and see what they do, whether or not they abide by my command which I have commanded them. 
        <FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">64.</FONT> But they shall not know it, and thou shalt not declare it to them, nor admonish them, but only record against each individual all the destruction which the shepherds effect each in his time and lay it all before me.' 
        <FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">65.</FONT> And I saw till those shepherds pastured in their season, and they began to slay and to destroy more than they were bidden, and they delivered those sheep into the hand of the lions. 
        <FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">66.</FONT> And the lions and tigers eat and devoured the greater part of those sheep, and the wild boars eat along with them; and they burnt that tower and demolished that house. 
        <FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">67.</FONT> And I became exceedingly sorrowful over that tower because that house of the sheep was demolished, and afterwards I was unable to see if those sheep entered that house. 
     <P><FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">68.</FONT> And the shepherds and their associates delivered over those sheep to all the wild beasts, to devour them, and each one of them received in his time a definite number: it was written by the other in a book how many each one of them destroyed of them. 
        <FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">69.</FONT> And each one slew and destroyed many more than was prescribed; and I began to weep and lament on account of those sheep. 
        <FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">70.</FONT> And thus in the vision I saw that one who wrote, how he wrote down every one that was destroyed by those shepherds, day by day, and carried up and laid down and showed actually the whole book to the <A Href="http://scriptures.lds.org/bdl/lord">Lord</A> of the sheep-<FONT Color="#228822" Size="-1">(even)</FONT> everything that they had done, and all that each one of them had made away with, and all that they had given over to destruction. 
        <FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">71.</FONT> And the book was read before the <A Href="http://scriptures.lds.org/bdl/lord">Lord</A> of the sheep, and He took the book from his hand and read it and sealed it and laid it down. 
     <P><FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">72.</FONT> And forthwith I saw how the shepherds pastured for twelve hours, and behold three of those sheep turned back and came and entered and began to build up all that had fallen down of that house; but the wild boars tried to hinder them, but they were not able. 
        <FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">73.</FONT> And they began again to build as before, and they reared up that tower, and it was named the high tower; and they began again to place a table before the tower, but all the bread on it was polluted and not pure. 
        <FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">74.</FONT> And as touching all this the eyes of those sheep were blinded so that they saw not, and <FONT Color="#228822" Size="-1">(the eyes of)</FONT> their shepherds likewise; and they delivered them in large numbers to their shepherds for destruction, and they trampled the sheep with their feet and devoured them. 
        <FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">75.</FONT> And the <A Href="http://scriptures.lds.org/bdl/lord">Lord</A> of the sheep remained unmoved till all the sheep were dispersed over the field and mingled with them <FONT Color="#228822" Size="-1">(i.e. the beasts)</FONT>, and they <FONT Color="#228822" Size="-1">(i.e. the shepherds)</FONT> did not save them out of the hand of the beasts. 
        <FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">76.</FONT> And this one who wrote the book carried it up, and showed it and read it before the <A Href="http://scriptures.lds.org/bdl/lord">Lord</A> of the sheep, and implored Him on their account, and besought Him on their account as he showed Him all the doings of the shepherds, and gave testimony before Him against all the shepherds. 
        <FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">77.</FONT> And he took the actual book and laid it down beside Him and departed.

     <P><FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">1.</FONT> And I saw till that in this manner thirty-five shepherds undertook the pasturing <FONT Color="#228822" Size="-1">(of the sheep)</FONT>, and they severally completed their periods as did the first; and others received them into their hands, to pasture them for their period, each shepherd in his own period. 
        <FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">2.</FONT> And after that I saw in my vision all the birds of <A Href="http://scriptures.lds.org/bdh/heaven">heaven</A> coming, the eagles, the vultures, the kites, the ravens; but the eagles led all the birds; and they began to devour those sheep, and to pick out their eyes and to devour their flesh. 
        <FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">3.</FONT> And the sheep cried out because their flesh was being devoured by the birds, and as for me I looked and lamented in my sleep over that shepherd who pastured the sheep. 
        <FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">4.</FONT> And I saw until those sheep were devoured by the dogs and eagles and kites, and they left neither flesh nor skin nor sinew remaining on them till only their bones stood there: and their bones too fell to the earth and the sheep became few. 
        <FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">5.</FONT> And I saw until that twenty-three had undertaken the pasturing and completed in their several periods fifty-eight times. 
     <P><FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">6.</FONT> But behold lambs were borne by those white sheep, and they began to open their eyes and to see, and to cry to the sheep. 
        <FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">7.</FONT> Yea, they cried to them, but they did not hearken to what they said to them, but were exceedingly deaf, and their eyes were very exceedingly blinded. 
        <FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">8.</FONT> And I saw in the vision how the ravens flew upon those lambs and took one of those lambs, and dashed the sheep in pieces and devoured them. 
        <FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">9.</FONT> And I saw till horns grew upon those lambs, and the ravens cast down their horns; and I saw till there sprouted a great horn of one of those sheep, and their eyes were opened. 
        <FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">10.</FONT> And it looked at them <FONT Color="#882222" Size="-1">[and their eyes opened]</FONT>, and it cried to the sheep, and the rams saw it and all ran to it. 
        <FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">11.</FONT> And notwithstanding all this those eagles and vultures and ravens and kites still kept tearing the sheep and swooping down upon them and devouring them: still the sheep remained silent, but the rams lamented and cried out. 
        <FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">12.</FONT> And those ravens fought and battled with it and sought to lay low its horn, but they had no power over it. 
        <FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">13.</FONT> And I saw till the shepherds and eagles and those vultures and kites came, and they cried to the ravens that they should break the horn of that ram, and they battled and fought with it, and it battled with them and cried that its help might come.
        <FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">16.</FONT> All the eagles and vultures and ravens and kites were gathered together, and there came with them all the sheep of the field, yea, they all came together, and helped each other to break that horn of the ram. 
        <FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">19.</FONT> And I saw till a great sword was given to the sheep, and the sheep proceeded against all the beasts of the field to slay them, and all the beasts and the birds of the <A Href="http://scriptures.lds.org/bdh/heaven">heaven</A> fled before their face. 
        <FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">14.</FONT> And I saw till that man, who wrote down the names of the shepherds <FONT Color="#882222" Size="-1">[and]</FONT>carried up unto the presence of the <A Href="http://scriptures.lds.org/bdl/lord">Lord</A> of the sheep <FONT Color="#882222" Size="-1">[came and helped it and showed it everything: he had come down for the help of that ram]</FONT>.

        <FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">17.</FONT> And I saw that man, who wrote the book according to the command of the <A Href="http://scriptures.lds.org/bdl/lord">Lord</A>, till he opened that book concerning the destruction which those twelve last shepherds had wrought, and showed that they had destroyed much more than their predecessors, before the <A Href="http://scriptures.lds.org/bdl/lord">Lord</A> of the sheep.
        <FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">18.</FONT> And I saw till the <A Href="http://scriptures.lds.org/bdl/lord">Lord</A> of the sheep came unto them and took in His hand the staff of his wrath, and smote the earth, and the earth clave asunder, and all the beasts and all the  irds of the <A Href="http://scriptures.lds.org/bdh/heaven">heaven</A> fell from among those sheep, and were swallowed up in the earth and it covered them.
        <FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">20.</FONT> And I saw till a throne was erected in the pleasant land, and the <A Href="http://scriptures.lds.org/bdl/lord">Lord</A> of the sheep sat Himself thereon, and the other took the sealed books and opened those books before the <A Href="http://scriptures.lds.org/bdl/lord">Lord</A> of the sheep. 
        <FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">21.</FONT> And the <A Href="http://scriptures.lds.org/bdl/lord">Lord</A> called those men the seven first white ones, and commanded that they should bring before Him, beginning with the first star which led the way, all the stars whose privy members were like those of horses, and they brought them all before Him. 
        <FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">22.</FONT> And He said to that man who wrote before Him, being one of those seven white ones, and said unto him: ' Take those seventy shepherds to whom I delivered the sheep, and who taking them on their own authority slew more than I commanded them.' 
        <FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">23.</FONT> And behold they were all bound, I saw, and they all stood before Him. 
        <FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">24.</FONT> And the judgement was held first over the stars, and they were judged and found guilty, and went to the place of condemnation, and they were cast into an abyss, full of fire and flaming, and full of pillars of fire. 
        <FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">25.</FONT> And those seventy shepherds were judged and found guilty, and they were cast into that fiery abyss. 
        <FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">26.</FONT> And I saw at that time how a like abyss was opened in the midst of the earth, full of fire, and they brought those blinded sheep, and they were all judged and found guilty and cast into this fiery abyss, and they burned; now this abyss was to the right of that house. 
        <FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">27.</FONT> And I saw those sheep burning and their bones burning. 
        <FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">28.</FONT> And I stood up to see till they folded up that old house; and carried off all the pillars, and all the beams and ornaments of the house were at the same time folded up with it, and they carried it off and laid it in a place in the south of the land. 
        <FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">29.</FONT> And I saw till the <A Href="http://scriptures.lds.org/bdl/lord">Lord</A> of the sheep brought a new house greater and loftier than that first, and set it up in the place of the first which had beer folded up: all its pillars were new, and its ornaments were new and larger than those of the first, the old one which He had taken away, and all the sheep were within it. 
        <FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">30.</FONT> And I saw all the sheep which had been left, and all the beasts on the earth, and all the birds of the <A Href="http://scriptures.lds.org/bdh/heaven">heaven</A>, falling down and doing homage to those sheep and making petition to and obeying them in every thing. 
        <FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">31.</FONT> And thereafter those three who were clothed in white and had seized me by my hand <FONT Color="#882222" Size="-1">[who had taken me up before]</FONT>, and the hand of that ram also seizing hold of me, they took me up and set me down in the midst of those sheep before the judgement took place. 
        <FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">32.</FONT> And those sheep were all white, and their wool was abundant and clean. 
        <FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">33.</FONT> And all that had been destroyed and dispersed, and all the beasts of the field, and all the birds of the <A Href="http://scriptures.lds.org/bdh/heaven">heaven</A>, assembled in that house, and the <A Href="http://scriptures.lds.org/bdl/lord">Lord</A> of the sheep rejoiced with great joy because they were all good and had returned to His house. 
        <FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">34.</FONT> And I saw till they laid down that sword, which had been given to the sheep, and they brought it back into the house, and it was sealed before the presence of the <A Href="http://scriptures.lds.org/bdl/lord">Lord</A>, and all the sheep were invited into that house, but it held them not. 
        <FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">35.</FONT> And the eyes of them all were opened, and they saw the good, and there was not one among them that did not see. 
        <FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">36.</FONT> And I saw that that house was large and broad and very full. 
        <FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">37.</FONT> And I saw that a white bull was born, with large horns and all the beasts of the field and all the birds of the air feared him and made petition to him all the time. 
        <FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">38.</FONT> And I saw till all their generations were transformed, and they all became white bulls; and the first among them became a lamb, and that lamb became a great animal and had great black horns on its head; and the <A Href="http://scriptures.lds.org/bdl/lord">Lord</A> of the sheep rejoiced over it and over all the oxen. 
        <FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">39.</FONT> And I slept in their midst: and I awoke and saw everything. 
        <FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">40.</FONT> This is the vision which I saw while I slept, and I awoke and blessed the <A Href="http://scriptures.lds.org/bdl/lord">Lord</A> of righteousness and gave Him glory. 
        <FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">41.</FONT> Then I wept with a great weeping and my tears stayed not till I could no longer endure it: when I saw, they flowed on account of what I had seen; for everything shall come and be fulfilled, and all the deeds of men in their order were shown to me. 
        <FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">42.</FONT> On that night I remembered the first dream, and because of it I wept and was troubled-because I had seen that vision.

And I asked one of the holy <A Href="http://scriptures.lds.org/bda/angels">angels</A> who was with me and said unto him: ' What is this shining thing? for it is not a <A Href="http://scriptures.lds.org/bdh/heaven">heaven</A> but only the flame of a blazing 6 fire, and the voice of weeping and crying and lamentation and strong pain.' 
        <FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">5.</FONT> And he said unto me: ' This place which thou seest-here are cast the <A Href="http://scriptures.lds.org/bds/spirit">spirits</A> of sinners and blasphemers, and of those who work wickedness, and of those who pervert everything that the <A Href="http://scriptures.lds.org/bdl/lord">Lord</A> hath spoken through the mouth of the prophets-<FONT Color="#228822" Size="-1">(even)</FONT> the things that shall be. 
        <FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">7.</FONT> For some of them are written and inscribed above in the <A Href="http://scriptures.lds.org/bdh/heaven">heaven</A>, in order that the <A Href="http://scriptures.lds.org/bda/angels">angels</A> may read them and know that which shall befall the sinners, and the <A Href="http://scriptures.lds.org/bds/spirit">spirits</A> of the humble, and of those who have afflicted their bodies, and been recompensed by <A Href="http://scriptures.lds.org/bdg/god">God</A>; and of those who have been put to shame by wicked men: 
        <FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">8.</FONT> Who love <A Href="http://scriptures.lds.org/bdg/god">God</A> and loved neither gold nor silver nor any of the good things which are in the world, but gave over their bodies to torture. 
        <FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">9.</FONT> Who, since they came into being, longed not after earthly food, but regarded everything as a passing breath, and lived accordingly, and the <A Href="http://scriptures.lds.org/bdl/lord">Lord</A> tried them much, and their <A Href="http://scriptures.lds.org/bds/spirit">spirits</A> were found pure so that they should bless His name. 
        <FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">10.</FONT> And all the blessings destined for them I have recounted in the books. And he hath assigned them their recompense, because they have been found to be such as loved <A Href="http://scriptures.lds.org/bdh/heaven">heaven</A> more than their life in the world, and though they were trodden under foot of wicked men, and experienced abuse and reviling from them and were put to shame, yet they blessed Me. 
        <FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">11.</FONT> And now I will summon the <A Href="http://scriptures.lds.org/bds/spirit">spirits</A> of the good who belong to the generation of light, and I will transform those who were born in darkness, who in the flesh were not recompensed with such honour as their faithfulness deserved. 
        <FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">12.</FONT> And I will bring forth in shining light those who have loved My holy name, and I will seat each on the throne of his honour. 
        <FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">13.</FONT> And they shall be resplendent for times without number; for righteousness is the judgement of <A Href="http://scriptures.lds.org/bdg/god">God</A>; for to the faithful He will give faithfulness in the habitation of upright paths. 
        <FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">14.</FONT> And they shall see those who were, born in darkness led into darkness, while the righteous shall be resplendent. 
        <FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">15.</FONT> And the sinners shall cry aloud and see them resplendent, and they indeed will go where days and seasons are prescribed for them.'
