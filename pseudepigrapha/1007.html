<h2>The Testament of Abraham</h2>

<p>I. Abraham lived the measure of his life, nine hundred and 
ninety-five years, and having lived all the years of his life in 
quietness, gentleness, and righteousness, the righteous one was 
exceeding hospitable; for, pitching his tent in the cross-ways at 
the oak of Mamre, he received every one, both rich and poor, kings 
and rulers, the maimed and the helpless, friends and strangers, 
neighbours and travellers, all alike did the devout, all-holy, 
righteous, and hospitable Abraham entertain. Even upon him, however, 
there came the common, inexorable, bitter lot of death, and the 
uncertain end of life. Therefore the Lord God, summoning his 
archangel Michael, said to him: Go down, chief- captain  Michael, to 
Abraham and speak to him concerning his death, that he may set his 
affairs in order, for I have blessed him as the stars of heaven, and 
as the sand by the sea-shore, and he is in abundance of long life 
and many possessions, and is becoming exceeding rich. Beyond all 
men, moreover, he is righteous in every goodness, hospitable and 
loving to the end of his life; but do thou, archangel Michael, go to 
Abraham, my beloved friend, and announce to him his death and assure 
him thus: Thou shalt at this time depart from this vain world, and 
shalt quit the body, and go to thine own Lord among the good. 

<p>II. And the chief-captain departed from before the face of God, 
and went down to Abraham to the oak of Mamre, and found the 
righteous Abraham in the field close by, sitting beside yokes of 
oxen for ploughing, together with the sons of Masek and other 
servants, to the number of twelve. And behold the chief-captain came 
to him, and Abraham, seeing the chief-captain Michael coming from 
afar, like to a very comely warrior, arose and met him as was his 
custom, meeting and entertaining all strangers. And the 
chief-captain saluted him and said: Hail, most honoured father, 
righteous soul chosen I. It came to pass, when the days of the death 
of Abraham drew near, that the Lord said to Michael: Arise and go to 
Abraham, my servant, and say to him, Thou shall depart from life, 
for lo! the days of thy temporal life are fulfilled: so that he may 
set his house in order before he die. 

<p>III. And Michael went and came to Abraham, and found him sitting 
before his oxen for ploughing, and he was exceeding. old in 
appearance, and had his son in his arms. Abraham, therefore, seeing 
the archangel Michael, rose from the ground and saluted him, not 
knowing who he was, and said to him: The Lord preserve thee. May thy 
journey be prosperous with thee. And Michael answered him: Thou art 
kind, good father. Abraham answered and said to him: Come, draw near 
to me, brother, and sit down a little while, that I may order a 
beast to be brought that we may go to my house, and thou mayest rest 
with me, for it is toward evening, and in the morning arise and go 
of God, true son of the heavenly one. Abraham said to the 
chief-captain: Hail, most honoured warrior, bright as the sun and 
most beautiful above all the sons of men; thou art welcome; 
therefore I beseech thy presence, tell me whence the youth of thy 
age has come; teach me, thy suppliant, whence and from what army and 
from what journey thy beauty has come hither. The chief-captain 
said: I, O righteous Abraham, come from the great city. I have been 
sent by the great king to take the place of a good friend of his, 
for the king has summoned him. And Abraham said, Come, my lord, go 
with me as far as my field. The chief-captain said: I come; and 
going into the field of the ploughing, they sat down beside the 
company. And Abraham said to his servants, the sons of Masek: Go ye 
to the herd of horses, and bring two horses, quiet, and gentle and 
tame, so that I and this stranger may sit thereon. But the 
chief-captain said, Nay, my lord, Abraham, let them not bring 
horses, for I abstain from ever sitting upon any four-footed beast. 
Is not my king rich in much merchandise, having power both over men 
and all kinds of cattle? but I abstain from ever slitting upon any 
four-footed beast. Let us go, then, O righteous soul, walking 
lightly until we reach thy house. And Abraham said, Amen, be it so. 

<p>II. And as they went on from the field toward his house, beside 
that way there stood a cypress tree, and by the command of the Lord 
the tree cried out with a human voice, saying, Holy, holy, holy is 
the Lord God that calls himself to those that love him; but Abraham 
hid the mystery, thinking that the chief-captain had not heard the 
voice of the tree. And coming nigh to the house they sat down in the 
court, and Isaac seeing the face of the angel said to Sarah his 
mother, My lady mother, behold, the man sitting with my father 
Abraham is not a son of the race of those that dwell on the earth. 
And Isaac ran, and saluted him, and fell at the feet of the 
Incorporeal, and the Incorporeal blessed him and said, The Lord God 
will grant thee his promise that he made to thy father Abraham and 
to his seed, and will also grant thee the precious prayer of thy 
father and thy mother. Abraham said to Isaac his son, My son Isaac, 
draw water from the well, and bring it me in the vessel, that we may 
wash the feet of this stranger, for he is tired, having come to us 
from off a long journey. And Isaac ran to the well and drew water in 
the vessel and brought it to them, and Abraham went up and washed 
whithersoever thou wilt, lest some evil beast meet thee and do thee 
hurt. And Michael enquired of Abraham, saying: Tell me thy name, 
before I enter thy house, lest I be burdensome to thee. Abraham 
answered and said, My parents called me Abram, and the Lord named me 
Abraham, saying: Arise and depart from thy house, and from thy 
kindred, and go into the land which I shall show unto thee. And when 
I went away into the land which the Lord showed me, he said to me: 
Thy name shall no more be called Abram, but thy name shall be 
Abraham. Michael answered and said to him: Pardon me, my father, 
experienced man of God, for I am a stranger, and I have heard of 
thee that thou didst go forty furlongs and didst bring a goat and 
slay it, entertaining angels in thy house, that they might rest 
there. Thus speaking together, they arose and went towards the 
house. And Abraham called one of his servants, and said to him: Go, 
bring me a beast that the stranger may sit upon it, for he is 
wearied with his journey. And Michael said: Trouble not the youth, 
but let us go lightly until we reach the house, for I love thy 
company. 

<p>III. And arising they went on, and as they drew nigh to the city, 
about three furlongs from it, they found a great tree having three 
hundred branches, like to a tamarisk tree. And they heard a voice 
from its branches singing, "Holy art thou, because thou hast kept 
the purpose for which thou wast sent." And Abraham heard the voice, 
and hid the mystery in his heart, saying within himself, What is the 
mystery that I have heard? As he came into the house, Abraham said 
to his servants, Arise, go out to the flocks, and bring three sheep, 
and slay them quickly, and make them ready that we may eat and 
drink, for this day is a feast for us. And the servants brought the 
sheep, and Abraham called his son Isaac, and said to him, My son 
Isaac, arise and put water in the vessel that we may wash the feet 
of this stranger. And he brought it as he was commanded, and Abraham 
said, I perceive, and so it shall be, that in this basin I shall 
never again wash the feet of any man coming to us as a guest. And 
Isaac hearing his father say this wept, and said to him, My father 
what is this that thou sayest, This is my last time to wash the feet 
of a stranger? And Abraham seeing his son weeping, also wept ex 
the feet of the chief captain Michael, and the heart of Abraham was 
moved, and he wept over the stranger. And Isaac, seeing his father 
weeping, wept also, and the chief captain, seeing them weeping, also 
wept with them, and the tears of the chief captain fell upon the 
vessel into the water of the basin and became precious stones. And 
Abraham seeing the marvel, and being astonished, took the stones 
secretly, and hid the mystery, keeping it by himself in his heart. 

<p>IV. And Abraham said to Isaac his son: Go, my beloved son, into 
the inner chamber of the house and beautify it. Spread for us there 
two couches, one for me and one for this man that is guest with us 
this day. Prepare for us there a seat and a candlestick and a table 
with abundance of every good thing. 

<p>Beautify the chamber, my son, and spread under us linen and 
purple and fine linen. Burn there every precious and excellent 
incense, and bring sweet-smelling plants from the garden and fill 
our house with them. Kindle seven lamps full of oil, so that we may 
rejoice, for this man that is our guest this day is more glorious 
than kings or rulers, and his appearance surpasses all the sons of 
men. And Isaac prepared all things well, and Abraham taking the 
archangel Michael went into the chamber, and they both eat down upon 
the couches, and between them he placed a table with abundance of 
every good thing. Then the chief captain arose and went out, as if 
by constraint of his belly to make issue of water, and ascended to 
heaven in the twinkling of an eye, and stood before the Lord, and 
said to him: Lord and Master, let thy power know that I am unable to 
remind that righteous man of his death, for I 
have not seen upon the earth a man like him, pitiful, hospitable, 
righteous, truthful, devout, refraining from every evil deed. And 
now know, Lord, that I 
cannot remind him of his death. And the Lord said: Go down, 
chief-captain Michael, to my friend Abraham, and whatever he say to 
thee, that do thou also, and whatever he eat, eat thou also with 
him. And I will send my holy spirit upon his son Isaac, and will put 
the remembrance of his death into the heart of Isaac, so that even 
he in a dream may see the death of his father, and Isaac will relate 
the dream, and thou shalt interpret it, and he himself will know his 
end. And the chief-captain said, Lord, all the heavenly spirits are 
incorporeal, and neither eat nor drink, and this man has set before 
me a table with abundance of all good things earthly and 
corruptible. Now, Lord, what shall I do? How shall I escape him, 
ceedingly, and Michael seeing them weeping, wept also, and the tears 
of Michael fell upon the vessel and became a precious stone. 

<p>IV. When Sarah, being inside in her house, heard their weeping, 
she came out and said to Abraham, Lord, why is it that ye thus weep? 
Abraham answered, and mid to her, It is no evil. Go into thy house, 
and do thy own work, lest we be troublesome to the man. And Sarah 
went away, being about to prepare the supper. And the sun came near 
to setting, and Michael went out of the house, and was taken up into 
the heavens to worship before God, for at sunset all the angels 
worship God and Michael himself is the first of the angels. And they 
all worshipped him, and went each to his own place, but Michael 
spoke before the Lord and said, Lord, command me to be questioned 
before thy holy glory! And the Lord said to Michael, Announce 
whatsoever thou wilt! And the Archangel answered and said, Lord, 
thou didst send me to Abraham to say to him, Depart from thy body, 
and leave this world; the Lord calls thee; and I dare not, Lord, 
reveal myself to him, for he is thy friend, and a righteous man, and 
one that receives strangers. But I beseech thee, Lord, command the 
remembrance of the death of Abraham to enter into his own heart, and 
bid not me tell it him, for it is great abruptness to say, Leave the 
world, and especially to leave one's own body, for thou didst create 
him from the beginning to have pity on the souls of all men. Then 
the Lord said to Michael, Arise and go to Abraham, and lodge with 
him, and whatever thou seest him eat, eat thou also, and where-ever 
he shall sleep, sleep thou there also. For I will cast the thought 
of the death of Abraham into the heart of Isaac his son in a dream. 

<p> 
sitting at one table with him? The Lord said: Go down to him, and 
take no thought for this, for when thou sittest down with him, I 
will send upon thee a devouring spirit, and it will consume out of 
thy hands and through thy mouth all that is on the table. Rejoice 
together with him in everything, only thou shalt interpret well the 
things of the vision, that Abraham may know the sickle of death and 
the uncertain end of life, and may make disposal of all his 
possessions, for I have blessed him above the sand of the sea and as 
the stars of heaven. 

<p>V. Then the chief captain went down to the house of Abraham, and 
sat down with him at the table, and Isaac served them. And when the 
supper was ended, Abraham prayed after his custom, and the 
chief-captain prayed together with him, and each lay down to sleep 
upon his couch. And Isaac said to his father, Father, I too would 
fain sleep with you in this chamber, that I also may hear your 
discourse, for I love to hear the excellence of the conversation of 
this virtuous man. Abraham said, Nay, my son, but go to thy own 
chamber and sleep on thy own couch, lest we be troublesome to this 
man. Then Isaac, having received the prayer from them, and having 
blessed them, went to his own chamber and lay down upon Iris couch. 
But the Lord east the thought of death into the heart of Isaac as in 
a dream, and about the third hour of the night Isaac awoke and rose 
up from his couch, and came running to the chamber where his father 
was sleeping together with the archangel. Isaac, therefore, on 
reaching the door cried out, saying, My father Abraham, arise and 
open to me quickly, that I may enter and hang upon thy neck, and 
embrace thee before they take thee away from me. Abraham therefore 
arose and opened to him, and Isaac entered and hung upon his neck, 
and began to weep with a loud voice. Abraham therefore being moved 
at heart, also wept with a loud voice, and the chief-captain, seeing 
them weeping, wept also. Sarah being in her room, heard their 
weeping, and came running to them, and found them embracing and 
weeping. And Sarah said with weeping, My lord Abraham, what is this 
that ye weep? Tell me, my lord, has this brother that has been 
entertained by us this day brought thee tidings of Lot, thy 
brother's son, that he is dead? is it for this that ye grieve thus? 
The chief-captain answered and said to her, Nay, my sister Sarah, it 
is not as thou sayest, but thy son Isaac, methinks, beheld a dream, 
and came to us weeping, and we seeing him were moved in our hearts 
and wept. 

<p>V. Then Michael went into the house of Abraham on that evening, 
and found them preparing the supper, and they ate and drank and were 
merry. And Abraham said to his son Isaac, Arise, my son, and spread 
the man's couch that he may sleep, and set the lamp upon the stand. 
And Isaac did as his father commanded him, and Isaac said to his 
father, I too am coming to sleep beside you. Abraham answered him, 
Nay, my son, lest we be troublesome to this man, but go to thy own 
chamber and sleep. And Isaac not wishing to disobey his father's 
command, went away and slept in his own chamber. 

<p>VI. And it happened about the seventh hour of the night Isaac 
awoke, and came to the door of his father's chamber, crying out and 
saying, Open, father, that I may touch thee before they take thee 
away from me. Abraham arose and opened to him, and Isaac entered and 
hung upon his father's neck weeping, and kissed him with 
lamentations. And Abraham wept together with his son, and Michael 
saw them weeping and wept likewise. And Sarah hearing them weeping 
called from her bed-chamber, saying, My lord Abraham, why is this 
weeping? Has the stranger told thee of thy brother's son Lot that he 
is dead? or has aught else befallen us? Michael answered and said to 
Sarah, Nay, Sarah, I have brought no tidings of Lot, but I knew of 
all your kindness of heart, that therein ye excel all men upon 
earth, and the Lord has remembered you. 

<p> 

<p>VI. Then Sarah, hearing the excellence of the conversation of the 
chief-captain, straightway knew that it was an angel of the Lord 
that spoke. Sarah therefore signified to Abraham to come out towards 
the door, and said to him, My lord Abraham, knowest thou who this 
man is? Abraham said, I know not. Sarah said, Thou knowest, my lord, 
the three men from heaven that were entertained by us in our tent 
beside the oak of Mamre, when thou didst kill the kid without 
blemish, and set a table before them. After the flesh had been 
eaten, the kid rose again, and sucked its mother with great joy. 
owest thou not, my lord Abraham, that by promise they gave to us 
Isaac as the fruit of the womb? Of these three holy men this is one. 
Abraham said, O Sarah, in this thou speakest the truth. Glory and 
praise from our God and the Father. For late in the evening when I 
washed his feet in the basin I said in my heart, These are the feet 
of one of the three men that I washed then; and his tears that fell 
into the basin then became precious stones. And shaking them out 
from his lap he gave them to Sarah, saying, If thou believest me 
not, look now at these. And Sarah receiving them bowed down and 
saluted and said, Glory be to God that showeth us wonderful things. 
And now know, my lord Abraham, that there is among us the revelation 
of some thing, whether it be evil or good! 

<p>VII. And Abraham left Sarah, and went into the chamber, and said 
to Isaac, Come hither, my beloved son, tell me the truth, what it 
was thou sawest and what befell thee that thou camest so hastily to 
us. And Isaac answering began to say, I saw, my lord, in this night 
the sun and the moon above my head, surrounding me with its rays and 
giving me light. As I gazed at this and rejoiced, I saw the heaven 
opened, and a man bearing light descend from it, shining more than 
seven suns. And this man like the sun came and took away the sun 
from my head, and went up into the heavens from whence he came, but 
I was greatly grieved that he took away the sun from me. After a 
little, as I was still sorrowing and sore troubled, I saw this man 
come forth from heaven a second time, and he took away from me the 
moon also from off my head, and I 
wept greatly and called upon that man of light, and said, Do not, my 
lord, take away my glory from me; pity me and hear me, and if thou 
takest away the sun from me, then leave the moon to me. He said, 
Suffer them to be taken up to the king above, for he wishes them 
there. And he took them away from me, but he left the Then Sarah 
said to Abraham, How durst thou weep when the man of God has come in 
to thee, and why have thy eyes  shed tears for to-day there is great 
rejoicing? Abraham said to her, How knowest thou that this is a man 
of God? Sarah answered and said, Because I say and declare that this 
is one of the three men who were entertained by us at the oak of 
Mamre, when one of the servants went and brought a kid and thou 
didst kill it, and didst say to me, Arise, make ready that we may 
eat with these men in our house. Abraham answered and said, Thou has 
perceived well, O woman, for I too, when I washed his feet knew in 
my heart that these were the feet which I had washed at the oak of 
Mamre, and when I began to enquire concerning his journey, he said 
to me, I go to preserve Lot thy brother from the men of Sodom, and 
then I knew the mystery. 

<p>VII. And Abraham said to Michael, Tell me, man of God, and show 
to me why thou hast come hither. And Michael said. Thy son Isaac 
will show thee. And Abraham said to his son, My beloved son, tell me 
what thou hast seen in thy dream to-day, and wast frightened. Relate 
it to me. Isaac answered his father, I saw in my dream the sun and 
the moon, and there was a crown upon my head, and there came from 
heaven a man of great size, and shining as the light that is called 
the father of light. He took the sun from my head, and yet left the 
rays behind with me. And I wept and said, I beseech thee, my lord, 
take not away the glory of my head, and the light of my house, and 
all my glory. And the sun and the moon and the stars lamented, 
saying, Take not away the glory of our power. And that shining man 
answered and said to me, Weep not that I take the light of thy 
house, for it is taken up from troubles into rest, from a low estate 
to a high one; they lift him up from a narrow to a wide place; they 
raise him from darkness to light. And I said to him, I beseech thee, 
Lord, take also the 
rays upon me. The chief-captain said, Hear, O righteous Abraham; the 
sun which thy son saw is thou his father, and the moon likewise is 
Sarah his mother. The man bearing light who descended from heaven, 
this is the one sent from God who is to take thy righteous soul from 
thee. And now know, O most honored Abraham, that at this time thou 
shalt leave this worldly life, and remove to God. Abraham said to 
the chief captain O strangest of marvels! and now art thou he that 
shall take my soul from me? The chief-captain said to him, I am the 
chief-captain Michael, that stands before the lord, and I was sent 
to thee to remind thee of thy death, and then I shall depart to him 
as I was commanded. Abraham said, Now I know that thou art an angel 
of the Lord, and wast sent to take my soul, but I will not go with 
thee; but do thou whatever thou art commanded. 

<p>VIII. The chief-captain hearing these words immediately vanished, 
and ascending into heaven stood before God, and told all that he had 
seen in the house of Abraham; and the chief-captain said this also 
to his Lord, Thus says thy friend Abraham, I will not go with thee, 
but do thou whatever thou art commanded; and now, O Lord Almighty, 
doth thy glory and immortal kingdom order aught? God said to the 
chief-captain Michael, Go to my friend Abraham yet once again, and 
speak to him thus, Thus saith the Lord thy God, he that brought thee 
into the land of promise, that blessed thee above the sand of the 
sea and above the stars of heaven, that opened the womb of 
barrenness of Sarah, and granted thee Isaac as the fruit of the womb 
in old age, Verily I say unto thee that blessing I will bless thee, 
and multiplying I will multiply thy seed, and I will give thee all 
that thou shalt ask from me, for I am the Lord thy God, and besides 
me there is no other. Tell me why thou hast rebelled against me, and 
why there is grief in thee, and why thou rebelled against my 
archangel Michael? Knowest thou not that all who have come from Adam 
and Eve have died, and that none of the prophets has escaped death? 
None of those that rule as kings is immortal; none of thy 
forefathers has escaped the mystery of death. 

<p>They have all died, they have all departed into Hades, they are 
all gathered by the sickle of death. But upon thee I have not sent 
death, I have not suffered any deadly disease to come upon thee, I 
have not permitted the sickle of death to meet thee, I have not 
allowed the nets of Hades to enfold thee, I 
have never wished thee to meet with any evil. But for good comfort I 
have sent my rays with it. He said to me, There are twelve hours of 
the day, and then I 
shall take all the rays. As the shining man said this, I saw the sun 
of my house ascending into heaven, but that crown I saw no more, and 
that sun was like thee my father. And Michael said to Abraham, Thy 
son Isaac has spoken truth, for thou shalt go, and be taken up into 
the heavens, but thy body shall remain on earth, until seven 
thousand ages are fulfilled, for then all flesh shall arise. Now 
therefore, Abraham, set thy house in order, and thy children, for 
thou hast heard fully what is decreed concerning thee. 

<p> 
chief-captain Michael to thee, that thou mayst know thy departure 
from the world, and set thy house in order, and all that belongs to 
thee, and bless Isaac thy beloved son. And now know that I have done 
this not wishing to grieve thee. Wherefore then hast thou said to my 
chief-captain, I will not go with thee? Wherefore hast thou spoken 
thus? Knowest thou not that if I give leave to death and he comes 
upon thee, then I should see whether thou wouldst come or not? 

<p>IX. And the chief-captain receiving the exhortations of the Lord 
went down to Abraham, and seeing him the righteous one fell upon his 
face to the ground as one dead, and the chief-captain told him all 
that he had heard from the Most High. Then the holy and just Abraham 
rising with many tears fell at the feet of the Incorporeal, and 
besought him, saying, I beseech thee, chief-captain of the hosts 
above, since thou hast wholly deigned to come thyself to me a sinner 
and in all things thy unworthy servant, I beseech thee even now, O 
chief-captain, to carry my word yet again to the Most High, and thou 
shalt say to him, Thus saith Abraham thy servant, Lord, Lord, in 
every work and word which I have asked of thee thou hast heard me, 
and hast fulfilled all my counsel. Now, Lord, I resist not thy 
power, for I too know that I am not immortal but mortal. Since 
therefore to thy command all things yield, and fear and tremble at 
the face of thy power, I also fear, but I ask one:request of thee, 
and now, Lord and Master, hear my prayer, for while still in this 
body I desire to see all the inhabited earth, and all the creations 
which thou didst establish by one word, and when I see these, then 
if I shall depart from life I shall be without sorrow. So the 
chief-captain went back again, and stood before God, and told him 
all, saying, Thus saith thy friend Abraham, I desired to behold all 
the earth in my lifetime before I died. And the Most High hearing 
this, again commanded the chief-captain Michael, and said to him, 
Take a cloud of light, and the angels that have power over the 
chariots, and go down, take the righteous Abraham upon a chariot of 
the cherubim, and exalt him into the air of heaven that he may 
behold all the earth. 

<p>X. And the archangel Michael went down and took Abraham upon a 
chariot of the cherubim, and exalted him into the air of heaven, and 
led him upon the cloud together with sixty angels, and Abraham 
ascended upon the chariot over all the earth. And Abraham saw the 
world as it was in that day, some ploughing, others driving wains, 
in one place men herding flocks, and in another Abraham answered and 
said to Michael, I beseech thee, lord, if I shall depart from my 
body, I have desired to be taken up in my body that I may see the 
creatures that the Lord my God has created in heaven and on earth. 
Michael answered and said, This is not for me to do, but I shall go 
and tell the Lord of this, and if I am commanded I shall show thee 
all these things. 

<p>VIII. And Michael went up into heaven, and spoke before the Lord 
concerning Abraham, and the Lord answered Michael, Go and take up 
Abraham in the body, and show him all things, and whatsoever he 
shall say to thee do to him as to my friend. So Michael went forth 
and took up Abraham in the body on a cloud, and brought him to the 
river of Ocean. 

<p> 
watching them by night, and dancing and playing and harping, in 
another place men striving and contending at law, elsewhere men 
weeping and having the dead in remembrance. He saw also the 
newly-wedded received with honour, and in a word he saw all things 
that are done in the world, both good and bad. Abraham therefore 
passing over them saw men bearing swords, wielding in their hands 
sharpened swords, and Abraham asked the chief-captain, Who are 
these? The chief-captain said, These are thieves, who intend to 
commit murder, and to steal and burn and destroy. Abraham said, 
Lord, Lord, hear my voice, and command that wild beasts may come out 
of the wood and devour them. And even as he spoke there came wild 
beasts out of the wood and devoured them. And he saw in another 
place a man with a woman committing fornication with each other, and 
said, Lord, Lord, command that the earth may open and swallow them, 
and straightway the earth was cleft and swallowed them. And he saw 
in another place men digging through a house, and carrying away 
other men's possessions, and he said, Lord, Lord, command that fire 
may come down from heaven and consume them. And even as he spoke, 
fire came down from heaven and consumed them. And straightway there 
came a voice from heaven to the chief-captain, saying thus, O 
chief-captain Michael, command the chariot to stop, and turn Abraham 
away that he may not see all the earth, for if he behold all that 
live in wickedness, he will destroy all creation. For behold, 
Abraham has not sinned, and has no pity on sinners, but I have made 
the world, and desire not to destroy any one of them, but wait for 
the death of the sinner, till he be converted and live. But take 
Abraham up to the first gate of heaven, that he may see there the 
judgments and recompenses, and repent of the souls of the sinners 
that he has destroyed. 

<p>XI. So Michael turned the chariot and brought Abraham to the 
east, to the first gate of heaven; and Abraham saw two ways, the one 
narrow and contracted, the other broad and spacious, and there he 
saw two gates, the one broad on the broad way, and the other narrow 
on the narrow way. And outside the two gates there he saw a man 
sitting upon a gilded throne, and the appearance of that man was 
terrible, as of the Lord.  And they saw many souls driven by angels 
and led in through the broad gate, and other souls, few in number, 
that were taken by the angels through the narrow gate. And when the 
XII. And after Abraham had seen the place of judgment, the cloud 
took him down upon the firmament below, and Abraham, looking down 
upon the earth, saw a man committing adultery with a wedded woman. 
And Abraham turning said to Michael, Seest thou this wickedness? 
but, Lord, send fire from heaven to consume them. And straightway 
there came down fire and consumed them, for the Lord had said to 
Michael, Whatsoever Abraham shall ask thee to do for him, do thou. 
Abraham looked again, and saw other men railing at their companions, 
and said, Let the earth open and swallow them, and as he spoke the 
earth swallowed them alive. Again the cloud led him to another 
place, and Abraham saw some going into a desert place to commit 
murder, and he said to Michael, Seest thou this wickedness? but let 
wild beasts come out of the desert, and tear them in pieces, and 
that same hour wild beasts came out of the desert, and devoured 
them. Then the Lord God spoke to Michael saying, Turn away Abraham 
to his own house, and let him not go round all the creation that I 
have made, because he has no compassion on sinners, but I have 
compassion on sinners that they may turn and live, and repent of 
their sins and be saved. 

<p>(VIII.) And Abraham looked and saw two gates, the one small and 
the other large, and between the two gates sat a man upon a throne 
of great glory, and a multitude of angels round about him, and he 
was weeping, and again laughing, but his weeping exceeded his 
laughter seven-fold. And Abraham said to Michael, Who is this that 
sits between the two gates in great glory; sometimes he laughs, and 
sometimes he weeps, and his weeping exceeds his laughter seven-fold? 
And Michael said to Abraham, Knowest thou not who it is? And he 
said, No, lord. And Michael said to Abraham, Seest thou these two 
gates, the small and the great? These are they which 
wonderful one who sat upon the golden throne saw few entering 
through the narrow gate, and many entering through the broad one, 
straightway that wonderful one tore the hairs of his head and the 
sides of his beard, and threw himself on the ground from his throne, 
weeping and lamenting. But when he saw many souls entering through 
the narrow gate, then he arose from the ground and sat upon his 
throne in great joy, rejoicing and exulting. And Abraham asked the 
chief-captain, My lord chief-captain, who is this most marvelous 
man, adorned with such glory, and sometimes he weeps and laments, 
and sometimes he rejoices and exults? The incorporeal one said: This 
is the first-created Adam who is in such glory, and he looks upon 
the world because all are born from him, and when he sees many souls 
going through the narrow gate, then he arises and sits upon his 
throne rejoicing and exulting in joy, because this narrow gate is 
that of the just, that leads to life, and they that enter through it 
go into Paradise. For this, then, the first-created Adam rejoices, 
because he sees the souls being saved. But when he sees many souls 
entering through the broad gate, then he pulls out the hairs of his 
head, and casts himself on the ground weeping and lamenting 
bitterly, for the broad gate is that of sinners, which leads to 
destruction and eternal punishment. And for this the first-formed 
Adam falls from his throne weeping and lamenting for the destruction 
of sinners, for they are many that are lost, and they are few that 
are saved, for in seven thousand there is scarcely found one soul 
saved, being righteous and undefiled. 

<p>XII. While he was yet saying these things to me, behold two 
angels, fiery in aspect, and pitiless in mind, and severe in look, 
and they drove on thousands of souls, pitilessly lashing them with 
fiery thongs. The angel laid hold of one soul, and they drove all 
the souls in at the broad gate to destruction. So we also went along 
with the angels, and came within that broad gate, and between the 
two gates stood a throne terrible of aspect, of terrible crystal, 
gleaming as fire, and upon it sat a wondrous man bright as the sun, 
like to the Son of God. Before him stood a table like crystal, all 
of gold and fine linen, and upon the table there was lying a book, 
the thickness of it six cubits, and the breadth of it ten cubits, 
and on the right and left of it stood two angels holding paper and 
ink and pen. Before the table sat an angel of light, holding in his 
hand a balance, and on his left sat an angel all fiery, pitiless, 
and severe, holding in his hand a trumpet, having within it lead to 
life and to destruction. This man that sits between them is Adam, 
the first man whom the Lord created, and set him in this place to 
see every soul that departs from the body, seeing that all are from 
him. When, therefore, thou seest him weeping, know that he has seen 
many souls being led to destruction, but when thou seest him 
laughing, he has seen many souls being led into life. Seest thou how 
his weeping exceeds his laughter? Since he sees the greater part of 
the world being led away through the broad gate to destruction, 
therefore his weeping exceeds his laughter seven-fold. 

<p>IX. And Abraham said, And he that cannot enter through the narrow 
gate, can he not enter into life? Then Abraham wept, saying, Woe is 
me, what shall I do? for I am a man broad of body, and how shall I 
be able to enter by the narrow gate, by which a boy of fifteen years 
cannot enter? Michael answered and said to Abraham, Fear not, 
father, nor grieve, for thou shalt enter by it unhindered, and all 
those who are like thee. 

<p>And as Abraham stood and marveled. behold an angel of the Lord 
driving sixty thousand souls of sinners to destruction, And Abraham 
said to Michael, Do all these go into destruction? And Michael said 
to him, Yea, but lat us go and search among these souls, if there is 
among them even one righteous. And when they went, they found an 
angel holding in his hand one soul of a woman from among these sixty 
thousand, because he had found her sins weighing equally with all 
her works, and they were neither in motion nor at rest, but in a 
state between; but the other souls he led away to destruction. 
Abraham said to Michael, Lord, is this the angel that removes the 
souls from the body or not? Michael answered and said, This is 
death, and he leads them into the place of judgment, that the judge 
may try them. 

<p>X. And Abraham said, My lord, I beseech thee to lead me to the 
place of judgment so 
all-consuming fire with which to try the sinners. The wondrous man 
who sat upon the throne himself judged and sentenced the souls, and 
the two angels on the right and on the left wrote down, the one on 
the right the righteousness and the one on the left the wickedness. 
The one before the table, who held the balance, weighed the souls, 
and the fiery angel, who held the fire, tried the souls. And Abraham 
asked the chief-captain Michael, What is this that we behold? And 
the chief-captain said, These things that thou seest, holy Abraham, 
airs the judgment and recompense. And behold the angel holding the 
soul in his hand, and he brought it before the judge, and the judge 
said to one of the angels that served him, Open me this book, and 
find me the sins of this soul. And opening the book he found its 
sins and its righteousness equally balanced, and he neither gave it 
to the tormentors, nor to those that were saved, but set it in the 
midst. 

<p>XIII. And Abraham said, My lord chief-captain, who is this most 
wondrous judge? and who are the angels that write down? and who is 
the angel like the sun, holding the balance? and who is the fiery 
angel holding the fire? The chief-captain said, "Seest thou, most 
holy Abraham, the terrible man sitting upon the throne? This is the 
son of the first created Adam, who is called Abel, whom the wicked 
Cain killed, and he sits thus to judge all creation, and examines 
righteous men and sinners. For God has said, I shall not judge you, 
but every man born of man shall be judged. Therefore he has given to 
him judgment, to judge the world until his great and glorious 
coming, and then, O righteous Abraham, is the perfect judgment and 
recompense, eternal and unchangeable, which no one can alter. For 
every man has come from the first-created, and therefore they are 
first judged here by his son, and at the second coming they shall be 
judged by the twelve tribes of Israel, that I too may see how they 
are judged. Then Michael took Abraham upon a cloud, and led him into 
Paradise, and when he came to the place where the judge was, the 
angel came and gave that soul to the judge. And the soul said, Lord 
have mercy on me. And the judge said, How shall I have mercy upon 
thee, when thou hadst no mercy upon thy daughter which thou hadst, 
the fruit of thy womb? Wherefore didst thou slay her? It answered, 
Nay, Lord, slaughter has not been done by me, but my daughter has 
lied upon me. But the judge commanded him to come that wrote down 
the records, and behold cherubim carrying two books. And there was 
with them a man of exceeding great stature, having on his head three 
crowns, and the one crown was higher than the other two. These are 
called the crowns of witness. And the man had in his hand a golden 
pen, and the judge said to him, Exhibit the sin of this soul. And 
that man. opening one of the books of the cherubim, sought out the 
sin of the woman's soul and found it. And the judge said, O wretched 
soul, why sayest thou that thou hast not done murder? Didst thou 
not, after the death of thy husband, go and commit adultery with thy 
daughter's husband, and kill her? And he convicted her also of her 
other sins, whatsoever she had done from her youth. Hearing these 
things the woman cried out, saying, Woe is me, all the sins that I 
did in the world I forgot, but here they were not forgotten. Then 
they took her away also and gave her over to the tormentors. 

<p>XI. And Abraham said to Michael, Lord, who is this judge, and who 
is the other, who convicts the sins? And Michael said to Abraham, 
Seest thou the judge? This is Abel, who first testified, and God 
brought him hither to judge, and he that bears witness here is the 
teacher of heaven and earth, and the scribe of righteousness, Enoch, 
for the Lord sent them hither to write down the sins and 
righteousnesses of each one. Abraham said, And how can Enoch bear 
the weight of the souls, not having seen death? or how can he give 
sentence to all the souls? Michael said, If he gives sentence 
concerning the souls, it is not permitted; but Enoch himself does 
not give sentence, but it is the Lord who does so, and he has no 
more to do than only to write. For Enoch prayed to the Lord saying, 
I desire not, Lord, to give sentence on the souls, lest I be 
grievous to anyone; and the Lord said to Enoch, I shall command thee 
to write down the sins of the soul that makes atonement and it shall 
enter 
every breath and every creature. But the third time they shall be 
judged by the Lord God of all, and then, indeed, the end of that 
judgment is near, and the sentence terrible, and there is none to 
deliver. And now by three tribunals the judgment of the world and 
the recompense is made, and for this reason a matter is not finally 
confirmed by one or two witnesses, but by three witnesses shall 
everything be established. The two angels on the right hand and on 
the left, these are they that write down the sins and the 
righteousness, the one on the right hand writes down the 
righteousness, and the one on the left the sins. The angel like the 
sun, holding the balance in his hand, is the archangel, Dokiel the 
just weigher, and he weighs the righteousnesses and sins with the 
righteousness of God. The fiery and pitiless angel, holding the fire 
in his hand, is the archangel Puruel, who has power over fire, and 
tries the works of men through fire, and if the fire consume the 
work of any man, the angel of judgment immediately seizes him, and 
carries him away to the place of sinners, a most bitter place of 
punishment. But if the fire approves the work of anyone, and does 
not seize upon it, that man is justified, and the angel of 
righteousness takes him and carries him up to be saved in the lot of 
the just. And thus, most righteous Abraham, all things in all men 
are tried by fire and the balance." 

<p>XIV. And Abraham said to the chief-captain, My lord the 
chief-captain, the soul which the angel held in his hand, why was it 
adjudged to be set in the midst? The chief-captain said, Listen, 
righteous Abraham. Because the judge found its sins. and its 
righteousnesses equal, he neither committed it to judgment nor to be 
saved, until the judge of all shall come. Abraham said to the 
chief-captain, And what yet is wanting for the soul to be saved? The 
chief-captain said, If it obtains one righteousness above its sins, 
it enters into salvation. Abraham said to the chief-captain, Come 
hither, chief-captain Michael, let us make prayer for this soul, and 
see whether God will hear us. The chief-captain said, Amen, be it 
so; and they made prayer and entreaty for the soul, and God heard 
them, and when they rose up from their prayer they did not see the 
soul standing there. And Abraham said to the angel, Where is the 
soul that thou didst hold in the midst? And the angel answered, It 
has been saved by thy righteous prayer, and behold an angel of light 
has taken it and carried it up into Paradise. Abraham said, I 
glorify the name of God, the Most High, and his immeasurable mercy. 
And Abra into life, and if the soul make not atonement and repent, 
thou shalt find its sins written down and it shall be cast into 
punishment. 

<p> 
ham said to the chief-captain, I beseech thee, archangel, hearken to 
my prayer, and let us yet call upon the Lord, and supplicate his 
compassion, and entreat his mercy for the souls of the sinners whom 
I formerly, in my anger, cursed and destroyed, whom the earth 
devoured, and the wild beasts tore in pieces, and the fire consumed 
through my words. Now I know that I have sinned before the Lord our 
God. Come then, O Michael, chief-captain of the hosts above, come, 
let us call upon God with tears that he may forgive me my sin, and 
grant them to me. And the chief-captain heard him, and they made 
entreaty before the Lord, and when they had called upon him for a 
long space, there came a voice from heaven saying, Abraham, Abraham, 
I have hearkened to thy voice and thy prayer, and forgive thee thy 
sin, and those whom thou thinkest that I destroyed I have called up 
and brought them into life by my exceeding kindness, because for a 
season I have requited them in judgment, and those whom I destroy 
living upon earth, I will not requite in death. 

<p>XV. And the voice of the Lord said also to the chief-captain 
Michael, Michael, my servant, turn back Abraham to his house, for 
behold his end has come nigh, and the measure of his life is 
fulfilled, that he may set all things in order, and then take him 
and bring him to me. So the chief-captain, turning the chariot and 
the cloud, brought Abraham to his house, and going into his chamber 
he sat upon his couch. And Sarah his wife came and embraced the feet 
of the Incorporeal, and spoke humbly, saying, I give thee thanks, my 
lord, that thou hast brought my lord Abraham, for behold we thought 
he had been taken up from us. And his son Isaac also came and fell 
upon his neck, and in the same way all his men-slaves and 
women-slaves surrounded Abraham and embraced him, glorifying God. 
And the Incorporeal one said to them, Hearken, righteous Abraham. 
Behold thy wife Sarah, behold also thy beloved son Isaac, behold 
also all thy men-servants and maid-servants round about thee. Make 
disposition of all that thou hast, for the day has come nigh in 
which thou shalt depart from the body and go to the Lord once for 
all. Abraham said, Has the Lord said it, or sayest thou this of 
thyself? The chief-captain answered, Hearken, righteous Abraham. The 
Lord has commanded, and I tell it thee. Abraham said, I will not go 
with thee. The chief-captain, hearing these words, straightway went 
forth from the presence of Abraham, and went up into the heavens, 
and And about the ninth hour Michael brought Abraham back to his 
house. But Sarah his wife, not seeing what had become of Abraham, 
was consumed with grief, and gave up the ghost, and after the return 
of Abraham he found her dead, and buried her. 

<p> 
stood before God the Most High, and said, Lord Almighty, behold I 
have hearkened to Thy friend Abraham in all he has said to Thee, and 
have fulfilled his requests. I have shown to him Thy power, and all 
the earth and sea that is under heaven. I have shown to him judgment 
and recompense by means of cloud and chariots, and again he says, I 
will not go with thee. And the Most High said to the angel, Does my 
friend Abraham say thus again, I will not go with thee? The 
archangel said, Lord Almighty, he says thus, and I refrain from 
laying hands on him, because from the beginning he is Thy friend, 
and has done all things pleasing in Thy sight. There is no man like 
him on earth, not even Job the wondrous man, and therefore I refrain 
from laying hands on him. 

<p>Command, therefore, Immortal King, what shall be done. 

<p>XVI. Then the Most High said, Call me hither Death that is called 
the shameless countenance and the pitiless look. And Michael the 
Incorporeal went and said to Death, Come hither; the lord of 
creation, the immortal king, calls thee. And Death, hearing this, 
shivered and trembled, being possessed with great terror, and coming 
with great fear it stood before the invisible father, shivering, 
groaning and trembling, awaiting the command of the Lord. Therefore 
the invisible God said to Death, Come hither, thou bitter and fierce 
name of the world, hide thy fierceness, cover thy corruption, and 
cast away thy bitterness from thee, and put on thy beauty and all 
thy glory, and go down to Abraham my friend, and take him and bring 
him to me. But now also I tell thee not to terrify him, but bring 
him with fair speech, for he is my own friend. Having heard this, 
Death went out from the presence of the Most High, and put on a robe 
of great brightness, and made his appearance like the sun, and 
became fair and beautiful above the sons of men, assuming the form 
of an archangel, having his cheeks flaming with fire, and he 
departed to Abraham. Now the righteous Abraham went out of his 
chamber, and sat under the trees of Mamre, holding his chin in his 
hand, and awaiting the coming of the archangel Michael. And behold, 
a smell of sweet odor came to him, and a flashing of light, and 
Abraham turned and saw Death coming towards him in great glory and 
beauty, And Abraham arose and went to meet him, thinking that it was 
the chief-captain of God, and Death beholding him saluted him, 
saying, Rejoice, precious Abraham, righteous soul, true friend of 
the Most High God, and companion of the holy angels. 

<p>XIII. But when the day of the death of Abraham drew nigh, the 
Lord God said to Michael, Death will not dare to go near to take 
away the soul of my servant, because he is my friend, but go thou 
and adorn Death with great beauty, and send him thus to Abraham, 
that he may see him with his eyes. And Michael straightway, as he 
was commanded, adorned Death with great beauty, and sent him thus to 
Abraham that he might see him. And he sat down near to Abraham, and 
Abraham seeing Death sitting near to him was afraid with a great 
fear. And Death said to Abraham, Hail, holy soul! hail, friend of 
the Lord God! hail, consolation and entertainment of travelers! And 
Abraham said, Thou art welcome, servant of the Most High God. I 
beseech thee, tell me who thou art; and entering into my house 
partake of food and drink, and depart from me, for since I have seen 
thee sitting near to me my soul has been troubled. For I am not at 
all worthy to come near thee, for thou art an exalted spirit and I 
am flesh and blood, and therefore I cannot bear thy glory, for I see 
that thy beauty is not of this world. And Death said to Abraham, I 
tell thee, in all the creation that God has made, there has not been 
found one like thee, for even the Lord himself by searching has not 
found such an one upon the whole earth. And Abraham said to Death, 
How durst thou lie? for I see that thy 

<p>Abraham said to Death, Hail thou of appearance and form like the 
sun, most glorious helper, bringer of light, wondrous man, from 
whence does thy glory come to us, and who art thou, and whence 
comest thou? Then Death said, Most righteous Abraham, behold I tell 
thee the truth. I am the bitter lot of death. Abraham said to him, 
Nay, but thou art the comeliness of the world, thou art the glory 
and beauty of angels and men, thou art fairer in form than every 
other, and sayest thou, I am the bitter lot of death, and not 
rather, I am fairer than every good thing. Death said, I tell thee 
the truth. What the Lord has named me, that also I tell thee. 
Abraham said, For what art thou come hither? Death said, For thy 
holy soul am I come. Then Abraham said, I know what thou meanest, 
but I will not go with thee; and Death was silent and answered him 
not a word. 

<p>XVII. Then Abraham arose, and went into his house, and Death also 
accompanied him thither. And Abraham went up into his chamber, and 
Death went up with him. And Abraham lay down upon his couch, and 
Death came and sat by his feet. Then Abraham said, Depart, depart 
from me, for I desire to rest upon my couch. Death said, I will not 
depart until I take thy spirit from thee. Abraham said to him, By 
the immortal God I charge thee to tell me the truth. Art thou death? 
Death said to him, I am Death. I am the destroyer of the world. 
Abraham said, I beseech thee, since thou art Death, tell me if thou 
comest thus to all in such fairness and glory and beauty? Death 
said, Nay, my lord Abraham, for thy righteousnesses, and the 
boundless sea of thy hospitality, and the greatness of thy love 
towards God has become a crown upon my head, and in beauty and great 
peace and gentleness I approach the righteous, but to sinners I come 
in great corruption and fierceness and the greatest bitterness and 
with fierce and pitiless look. Abraham said, I beseech thee, hearken 
to me, and show me thy fierceness and all thy corruption and 
bitterness. And Death said, Thou canst not behold my fierceness, 
most righteous Abraham. Abraham said, Yes, I shall be able to behold 
all thy fierceness by means of the name of the living God, for the 
might of my God that is in heaven is with me. Then Death put off all 
his comeliness and beauty, and all his glory and the form like the 
sun with which he was clothed, and put upon himself a tyrant's robe, 
and made his appearance gloomy and fiercer than all kind of wild 
beasts, and more unclean than all uncleanness. And he showed to 
Abraham seven beauty is not of this world. And Death said to 
Abraham, Think not, Abraham, that this beauty is mine, or that I 
come thus to every man. Nay, but if any one is righteous like thee, 
I thus take crowns and come to him, but if it is a sinner I come in 
great corruption, and out of their sin I make a crown for my head, 
and I shake them with great fear, so that they are dismayed. Abraham 
therefore said to him, And whence comes thy beauty? And Death said, 
There is none other more full of corruption than I am. Abraham said 
to him, And art thou indeed he that is called Death? He answered him 
and said, I am the bitter name. I am weeping . . . . 

<p>XIV. And Abraham said to Death, Show us thy corruption. And Death 
made manifest his corruption; and he had two heads, the one had the 
face of a serpent and by it some die at once by asps, and the other 
bead was like a sword; by it some die by the sword as by bows. 

<p> 
fiery heads of serpents and fourteen faces, (one) of flaming fire 
and of great fierceness, and a face of darkness, and a most gloomy 
face of a viper, and a face of a most terrible precipice, and a face 
fiercer than an asp, and a face of a terrible lion, and a face of a 
cerastes and basilisk. He showed him also a face of a fiery 
scimitar, and a sword-bearing face, and a face of lightning, 
lightening terribly, and a noise of dreadful thunder. He showed him 
also another face of a fierce stormy sea, and a fierce rushing 
river, and a terrible three-headed serpent, and a cup mingled with 
poisons, and in short he showed to him great fierceness and 
unendurable bitterness, and every mortal disease as of the odour of 
Death. And from the great bitterness and fierceness there died 
servants and maid-servants in number about seven thousand, and the 
righteous Abraham came into indifference of death so that his spirit 
failed him. 

<p>XVIII. And the all-holy Abraham, seeing these things thus, said 
to Death, I beseech thee, all-destroying Death, hide thy fierceness, 
and put on thy beauty and the shape which thou hadst before. And 
straightway Death hid his fierceness, and put on his beauty which he 
had before. And Abraham said to Death, Why hast thou done this, that 
thou hast slain all my servants and maidservants? Has God sent thee 
hither for this end this day? Death said, Nay, my lord Abraham, it 
is not as thou sayest, but on thy account was I sent hither. Abraham 
said to Death, How then have these died? Has the Lord not spoken it? 
Death said, Believe thou, most righteous Abraham, that this also is 
wonderful, that thou also wast not taken away with them. 
Nevertheless I tell thee the truth, for if the right hand of God had 
not been with thee at that time, thou also wouldst have had to 
depart from this life. The righteous Abraham said, Now I know that I 
have come into indifference of death, so that my spirit fails, but I 
beseech thee, all-destroying Death, since my servants have died 
before their time, come let us pray to the Lord our God that he may 
hear us and raise up those who died by thy fierceness before their 
time. And death said, Amen, be it so. Therefore Abraham arose and 
fell upon the face of the ground in prayer, and Death together with 
him, and the Lord sent a spirit of life upon those that were dead 
and they were made alive again. Then the righteous Abraham gave 
glory to God. 

<p>XIX. And going up into his chamber he lay down, and Death came 
and stood before him. And Abraham said to him, Depart from me, for I 
desire to rest, because my In that day the servants of Abraham died 
through fear of Death, and Abraham seeing them prayed to the Lord, 
and he raised them up. 

<p> 
spirit is in indifference. Death said, I will not depart from thee 
until I take thy soul. And Abraham with an austere countenance and 
angry look said to Death, Who has ordered thee to say this? Thou 
sayest these words of thyself boastfully, and I will not go with 
thee until the chief-captain Michael come to me, and I shall go with 
him. But this also I tell thee, if thou desirest that I shall 
accompany thee, explain to me all thy changes, the seven fiery heads 
of serpents and what the face of the precipice is, and what the 
sharp sword, and what the loud-roaring river, and what the 
tempestuous sea that rages so fiercely. Teach me also the 
unendurable thunder, and the terrible lightning, and the 
evil-smelling cup mingled with poisons. Teach me concerning all 
these. And Death answered, Listen, righteous Abraham. For seven ages 
I destroy the world and lead all down to Hades, kings and rulers, 
rich and poor, slaves and free men, I convoy to the bottom of Hades, 
and for this I showed thee the seven heads of serpents. The face of 
fire I showed thee because many die consumed by fire, and behold 
death through a face of fire. The face of the precipice I showed 
thee, because many men die descending from the tops of trees or 
terrible precipices and losing their life, and see death in the 
shape of a terrible precipice. The face of the sword I showed thee 
because many are slain in wars by the sword, and see death as a 
sword. The face of the great rushing river I showed thee because 
many are drowned and perish snatched away by the crossing of many 
waters and carried off by great rivers, and see death before their 
time. The face of the angry raging sea I showed thee because many in 
the sea falling into great surges and becoming shipwrecked are 
swallowed up and behold death as the sea. The unendurable thunder 
and the terrible lightning I showed thee because many men in the 
moment of anger meet with unendurable thunder and terrible lightning 
coming to seize upon men, and see death thus. I showed thee also the 
poisonous wild beasts, asps and basilisks, leopards and lions and 
lions' whelps, bears and vipers, and in short the face of every wild 
beast I showed thee, most righteous one, because many men are 
destroyed by wild beasts, and others by poisonous snakes, serpents 
and asps and cerastes and basilisks and vipers, breathe out their 
life and die. I showed thee also the destroying cups mingled with 
poison, because many men being given poison to drink by other men 
straightway depart unexpectedly. 

<p>XX. Abraham said, I beseech thee, is there also an unexpected 
death? Tell me. Death said, Verily, verily, I tell thee in the truth 
of God that there are seventy-two deaths. One is the just death, 
buying its fixed time, and many men in one hour enter into death 
being given over to the grave. Behold, I have told thee all that 
thou hast asked, now I tell thee, most righteous Abraham, to dismiss 
all counsel, and cease from asking anything once for all, and come, 
go with me, as the God and judge of all has commanded me. Abraham 
said to Death, Depart from me yet a little, that I may rest on my 
couch, for I am very faint at heart, for since I have seen thee with 
my eyes my strength has failed me, all the limbs of my flesh seem to 
me a weight as of lead, and my spirit is distressed exceedingly. 
Depart for a little; for I have said I cannot bear to see thy shape. 
Then Isaac his son came and fell upon his breast weeping, and his 
wife Sarah came and embraced his feet, lamenting bitterly. There 
came also his men slaves and women slaves and surrounded his couch, 
lamenting greatly. And Abraham came into indifference of death, and 
Death said to Abraham, Come, take my right hand, and may 
cheerfulness and life and strength come to thee. For Death deceived 
Abraham, and he took his right hand, and straightway his soul 
adhered to the hand of Death. And immediately the archangel Michael 
came with a multitude of angels and took up his precious soul in his 
hands in a divinely woven linen cloth, and they tended the body of 
the just Abraham with divine ointments and perfumes until the third 
day after his death, and buried him in the land of promise, the oak 
of Mamre, but the angels received his precious soul, and ascended 
into heaven, singing the hymn of "thrice holy" to the Lord the God 
of all, and they set it there to worship the God and Father. And 
after great praise and glory had been given to the Lord, and Abraham 
bowed down to worship, there came the undefiled voice of the God and 
Father saying thus, Take therefore my friend Abraham into Paradise, 
where are the tabernacles of my righteous ones, and the abodes of my 
saints isaac and Jacob in his bosom, where there is no trouble, nor 
grief, nor sighing, but peace and rejoicing and life unending. (And 
let us, too, my beloved brethren, imitate the hospitality of the 
patriarch Abraham, and attain to his virtuous way of life, that we 
may be thought worthy of the life eternal, glorifying the Father, 
Son and Holy Ghost; to whom be glory and power forever. Amen.) 

<p>But God returned and removed the soul of Abraham as in a dream, 
and the archangel Michael took it up into the heavens. And Isaac 
buried his father beside his mother Sarah, glorifying and praising 
God, for to him is due glory, honour and worship, of the Father, Son 
and Holy Ghost, now and always and to all eternity. Amen.
