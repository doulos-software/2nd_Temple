 "The Book is essentially Jewish," wrote George H. Box, with "features . . . which suggest Essene origin." 
 From the Essenes it passed, he suggested, "to Ebionite circles . . . and thence, in some form, found its way into Gnostic circles," 
 though "Gnostic elements in our Book are not very pronounced." --Dr. Hugh Nibley (Abraham in Egypt)</I>
