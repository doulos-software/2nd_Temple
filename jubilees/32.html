<p>[Chapter 32]
<OL>
    <LI>And he abode that night at Bethel, and Levi dreamed that they had ordained and made
him the priest of the Most High God, him and his sons for ever; and he awoke from his sleep and
blessed
    the Lord.  <LI>And Jacob rose early in the morning, on the fourteenth of this month, and he
gave a tithe of all that came with him, both of men and cattle, both of gold and every vessel and
garment,
    yea, he gave tithes of all.  <LI>And in those days Rachel became pregnant with her son
Benjamin.  And Jacob counted his sons from him upwards and Levi fell to the portion of the Lord,
and his
    father clothed him in the garments of the priesthood and filled his hands.  <LI>And on the
fifteenth of this month, he brought to the altar fourteen oxen from amongst the cattle, and
twenty-eight rams, and forty-nine sheep, and seven lambs, and twenty-one kids of the goats as a
burnt-offering on the 
    altar of sacrifice, well pleasing for a sweet savour before God.  <LI>This was his offering, in
consequence of the vow which he had vowed that he would give a tenth, with their fruit-offerings
and their drink-
    offerings.  <LI>And when the fire had consumed it, he burnt incense on the fire over the fire,
and for a thank-offering two oxen and four rams and four sheep, four he-goats, and two sheep of
a year old,
    and two kids of the goats; and thus he did daily for seven days.  <LI>And he and all his sons
and his men were eating (this) with joy there during seven days and blessing and thanking the
Lord, who
    had delivered him out of all his tribulation and had given him his vow.  <LI>And he tithed all
the clean animals, and made a burnt sacrifice, but the unclean animals he gave (not) to Levi his
son, and he
    gave him all the souls of the men. <LI>And Levi discharged the priestly office at Bethel before
Jacob his father in preference to his ten brothers, and he was a priest there, and Jacob gave his
vow:  thus
    he tithed again the tithe to the Lord and sanctified it, and it became holy unto Him. 
<LI>And for this reason it is ordained on the heavenly tablets as a law for the tithing again the tithe to
eat before the Lord from year to year, in the place where it is chosen that His name should dwell,
and to this law
    there is no limit of days for ever.  <LI>This ordinance is written that it may be fulfilled from
year to year in eating the second tithe before the Lord in the place where it has been chosen, and
nothing
    shall remain over from it from this year to the year following.  <LI>For in its year shall the
seed be eaten till the days of the gathering of the seed of the year, and the wine till the days of the
wine,
    and the oil till the days of its season.  <LI>And all that is left thereof and becomes old, let it
be regarded
   as polluted:  let it be burnt with fire, for it is unclean.   <LI>And thus let them eat it together
in the
    sanctuary, and let them not suffer it to become old.  <LI>And all the tithes of the oxen and
sheep shall be holy unto the Lord, and shall belong to his priests, which they will eat before Him
from year to
    year; for thus is it ordained and engraven regarding the tithe on the heavenly tablets. 
<LI>And on the following night, on the twenty-second day of this month, Jacob resolved to build that
place, and to surround the court with a wall, and to sanctify it and make it holy for ever, for
himself and his children
    after him.  <LI>And the Lord appeared to him by night and blessed him and said unto him: 
'Thy name
     shall not be called Jacob, but Israel shall they name thy name.'  <LI>And He said unto him
again:  'I am the Lord who created the heaven and the earth, and I will increase thee and multiply
thee exceedingly, and kings shall come forth from thee, and they shall judge everywhere wherever
the foot
    of the sons of men has trodden.  <LI>And I will give to thy seed all the earth which is under
heaven, and they shall judge all the nations according to their desires, and after that they shall get
possession
    of the whole earth and inherit it for ever.'  <LI>And He finished speaking with him, and He
went up
    from him.  and Jacob looked till He had ascended into heaven.  <LI>And he saw in a vision
of the night, and behold an angel descended from heaven with seven tablets in his hands, and he
gave them to Jacob, and he read them and knew all that was written therein which would befall
him and his sons
    throughout all the ages.  <LI>And he showed him all that was written on the tablets, and
said unto him:  'Do not build this place, and do not make it an eternal sanctuary, and do not dwell
here; for this is not the place.  Go to the house of Abraham thy father and dwell with Isaac thy
father until the day
    of the death of thy father.  <LI>For in Egypt thou shalt die in peace, and in this land thou
shalt be buried
    with honour in the sepulchre of thy fathers, with Abraham and Isaac.  <LI>Fear not, for as
thou hast seen and read it, thus shall it all be; and do thou write down everything as thou hast seen
and read.'
    <LI>And Jacob said:  'Lord, how can I remember all that I have read and seen?  'And he said
unto 
    him:  'I will bring all things to thy remembrance.'  <LI>And he went up from him, and he
awoke from his sleep, and he remembered everything which he had read and seen, and he wrote
down all the
    words which he had read and seen.  <LI>And he celebrated there yet another day, and he
sacrificed thereon according to all that he sacrificed on the former days, and called its name
'Addition,' for
   this day was added and the former days he called 'The Feast '.   <LI>And thus it was
manifested that it should be, and it is written on the heavenly tablets:  wherefore it was revealed to
him that he should
    celebrate it, and add it to the seven days of the feast.  <LI>And its name was called
'Addition,' because that it was recorded amongst the days of the feast days, according to the
number of
    the days of the year.  <LI>And in the night, on the twenty-third of this month, Deborah
Rebecca's nurse died, and they buried her beneath the city under the oak of the river, and he called
the name of this
    place, 'The river of Deborah,' and the oak, 'The oak of the mourning of Deborah.'  <LI>And
Rebecca went and returned to her house to his father Isaac, and Jacob sent by her hand rams and
sheep and
    he-goats that she should prepare a meal for his father such as he desired.  <LI>And he went
after his
    mother till he came to the land of Kabratan, and he dwelt there.  <LI>And Rachel bare a son
in the night, and called his name 'Son of my sorrow '; for she suffered in giving him birth:  but his
father called his name Benjamin, on the eleventh of the eighth month in the first of the sixth week
of this
    jubilee. [2143 A.M.]  <LI>And Rachel died there and she was buried in the land of Ephrath,
the same is Bethlehem, and Jacob built a pillar on the grave of Rachel, on the road above her
grave.
