<p>[Chapter 23]
<OL>
    <LI>And he placed two fingers of Jacob on his eyes, and he blessed the God of gods, and he
covered his face and stretched out his feet and slept the sleep of eternity, and was gathered to his
fathers.
    <LI>And notwithstanding all this Jacob was lying in his bosom, and knew not that Abraham,
his father's
    father, was dead.  <LI>And Jacob awoke from his sleep, and behold Abraham was cold as
ice, and he
    said 'Father, father'; but there was none that spake, and he knew that he was dead.  <LI>And
he arose from his bosom and ran and told Rebecca, his mother; and Rebecca went to Isaac in the
night, and told him; and they went together, and Jacob with them, and a lamp was in his hand,
and
    when they had gone in they found Abraham lying dead.  <LI>And Isaac fell on the face of his
father
    and wept and kissed him.  <LI>And the voices were heard in the house of Abraham, and
Ishmael his son arose, and went to Abraham his father, and wept over Abraham his father, he and
all the house
    of Abraham, and they wept with a great weeping.  <LI>And his sons Isaac and Ishmael
buried him in the double cave, near Sarah his wife, and they wept for him forty days, all the men
of his house, and Isaac and Ishmael, and all their sons, and all the sons of Keturah in their places;
and the days of 
    weeping for Abraham were ended.  <LI>And he lived three jubilees and four weeks of years,
one hundred 
    and seventy-five years, and completed the days of his life, being old and full of days.  <LI>For
the days of the forefathers, of their life, were nineteen jubilees; and after the Flood they began to
grow less than nineteen jubilees, and to decrease in jubilees, and to grow old quickly, and to be
full of their days by reason of manifold tribulation and the wickedness of their ways, with the
exception of
    Abraham.  <LI>For Abraham was perfect in all his deeds with the Lord, and well-pleasing in
righteousness all the days of his life; and behold, he did not complete four jubilees in his life, when
he had
    grown old by reason of the wickedness, and was full of his days.  <LI>And all the
generations which shall arise from this time until the day of the great judgment shall grow old
quickly, before they complete two jubilees, and their knowledge shall forsake them by reason of
their old age Land all their know-
    ledge shall vanish away].  <LI>And in those days, if a man live a jubilee and a-half of years,
they shall say regarding him:  'He has lived long, and the greater part of his days are pain and
sorrow and
    tribulation, and there is no peace:  <LI>For calamity follows on calamity, and wound on
wound, and tribulation on tribulation, and evil tidings on evil tidings, and illness on illness, and all
evil judgments such as these, one with another, illness and overthrow, and snow and frost and ice,
and fever, and chills, and torpor, and famine, and death, and sword, and captivity, and all kinds of
calamities and
    pains.'  <LI>And all these shall come on an evil generation, which transgresses on the earth: 
their works 
    are uncleanness and fornication, and pollution and abominations.  <LI>Then they shall say: 
'The days of the forefathers were many (even), unto a thousand years, and were good; but behold,
the days of our life, if a man has lived many, are three score years and ten, and, if he is strong,
four score years,
    and those evil, and there is no peace in the days of this evil generation.'  <LI>And in that
generation the sons shall convict their fathers and their elders of sin and unrighteousness, and of
the words of their mouth and the great wickednesses which they perpetrate, and concerning their
forsaking the covenant which the Lord made between them and Him, that they should observe
and do all His commandments and His ordinances and all His laws, without departing either to the
right hand or the left.
    <LI>For all have done evil, and every mouth speaks iniquity and all their works are an
uncleanness and
     an abomination, and all their ways are pollution, uncleanness and destruction.  <LI>Behold
the earth shall be destroyed on account of all their works, and there shall be no seed of the vine,
and no oil; for their works are altogether faithless, and they shall all perish together, beasts and
cattle and birds, and
    all the fish of the sea, on account of the children of men.  <LI>And they shall strive one with
another, the young with the old, and the old with the young, the poor with the rich, the lowly with
the great, and the beggar with the prince, on account of the law and the covenant; for they have
forgotten commandment, and covenant, and feasts, and months, and Sabbaths, and jubilees, and
all judgments.
    <LI>And they shall stand &lt;with bows and&gt; swords and war to turn them back into the way;
but they shall
    not return until much blood has been shed on the earth, one by another.  <LI>And those
who have escaped shall not return from their wickedness to the way of righteousness, but they
shall all exalt themselves to deceit and wealth, that they may each take all that is his neighbour's,
and they shall name the great name, but not in truth and not in righteousness, and they shall defile
the holy of
    holies with their uncleanness and the corruption of their pollution.  <LI>And a great
punishment shall befall the deeds of this generation from the Lord, and He will give them over to
the sword and to
    judgment and to captivity, and to be plundered and devoured.  <LI>And He will wake up
against them the sinners of the Gentiles, who have neither mercy nor compassion, and who shall
respect the person of none, neither old nor young, nor any one, for they are more wicked and
strong to do evil than all the children of men.
<P>
     And they shall use violence against Israel and transgression against Jacob, <BR>
     And much blood shall be shed upon the earth, <BR>
     And there shall be none to gather and none to bury.<P>

<LI>In those days they shall cry aloud, <BR>
     And call and pray that they may be saved from the hand of the sinners, the Gentiles; <BR>
     But none shall be saved.<P>

<LI>And the heads of the children shall be white with grey hair,<BR>
     And a child of three weeks shall appear old like a man of one hundred years, <BR>
     And their stature shall be destroyed by tribulation and oppression.<P>

<LI>And in those days the children shall begin to study the laws, <BR>
     And to seek the commandments, <BR>
     And to return to the path of righteousness.<P>

<LI>And the days shall begin to grow many and increase amongst those children of men <BR>
     Till their days draw nigh to one thousand years.  <BR>
     And to a greater number of years than (before) was the number of the days.<P>

<LI>And there shall be no old man <BR>
     Nor one who is &lt;not&gt; satisfied with his days, <BR>
     For all shall be (as) children and youths.<P>

<LI>And all their days they shall complete and live in peace and in joy, <BR>
     And there shall be no Satan nor any evil destroyer; <BR>
     For all their days shall be days of blessing and healing.<P>

<LI>And at that time the Lord will heal His servants, <BR>
     And they shall rise up and see great peace, <BR>
     And drive out their adversaries.<P>

     And the righteous shall see and be thankful, <BR>
     And rejoice with joy for ever and ever, <BR>
     And shall see all their judgments and all their curses on their enemies.  <P>

<LI>And their bones shall rest in the earth, <BR>
     And their spirits shall have much joy, <BR>
     And they shall know that it is the Lord who executes judgment, <BR>
     And shows mercy to hundreds and thousands and to all that love Him<P>

<LI>And do thou, Moses, write down these words; for thus are they written, and they record
(them) on the heavenly tablets for a testimony for the generations for ever.
