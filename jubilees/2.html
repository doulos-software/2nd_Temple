<p>[Chapter 2]
<OL>
    <LI>And the angel of the presence spake to Moses according to the word of the Lord,
saying:  Write the complete history of the creation, how in six days the Lord God finished all His
works and all that He created, and kept Sabbath on the seventh day and hallowed it for all ages,
and 
    appointed it as a sign for all His works.  <LI>For on the first day He created the heavens
which are above and the earth and the waters and all the spirits which serve before him -the angels
of the presence, and the angels of sanctification, and the angels [of the spirit of fire and the angels]
of the spirit of the winds, and the angels of the spirit of the clouds, and of darkness, and of snow
and of hail and of hoar frost, and the angels of the voices and of the thunder and of the lightning,
and the angels of the spirits of cold and of heat, and of winter and of spring and of autumn and of
summer and of all the spirits of his creatures which are in the heavens and on the earth, (He
created) the abysses and the darkness, eventide &lt;and night&gt;, and the light, dawn and day, which
He hath
    prepared in the knowledge of his heart.  <LI>And thereupon we saw His works, and praised
Him, and lauded before Him on account of all His works; for seven great works did He create on
the first day.
    <LI>And on the second day He created the firmament in the midst of the waters, and the
waters were divided on that day -half of them went up above and half of them went down below
the firmament (that was) in the midst over the face of the whole earth.  And this was the only
work (God) created
    on the second day.  <LI>And on the third day He commanded the waters to pass from off the
face of
    the whole earth into one place, and the dry land to appear.  <LI>And the waters did so as He
commanded them, and they retired from off the face of the earth into one place outside of this
firmament,
    and the dry land appeared.  <LI>And on that day He created for them all the seas according
to their separate gathering-places, and all the rivers, and the gatherings of the waters in the
mountains and on all the earth, and all the lakes, and all the dew of the earth, and the seed which
is sown, and all sprouting things, and fruit-bearing trees, and trees of the wood, and the garden of
Eden, in Eden
    and all <em>plants after their kind</em>.  <LI>These four great works God created on the third day. 
And on the fourth day He created the sun and the moon and the stars, and set them in the
firmament of the heaven, to give light upon all the earth, and to rule over the day and the night,
and divide the
    light from the darkness.  <LI>And God appointed the sun to be a great sign on the earth for
days and
    for sabbaths and for months and for feasts and for years and for sabbaths of years and
for jubilees and for all seasons of the years.  <LI>And it divideth the light from the darkness [and] for
prosperity, that all things may prosper which shoot and grow on the earth.  
<LI>These three kinds He
made on the fourth day.  And on the fifth day He created great sea monsters in the depths of the
waters, for these were the first things of flesh that were created by his hands, the fish and
everything that moves in the
    waters, and everything that flies, the birds and all their kind.  <LI>And the sun rose above
them to prosper (them), and above everything that was on the earth, everything that shoots out of
the earth, and all
    fruit-bearing trees, and all flesh.  <LI>These three kinds He created on the fifth day.  And on
the sixth day
    He created all the animals of the earth, and all cattle, and everything that moves on the
earth.  <LI>And after all this He created man, a man and a woman created He them, and gave him
dominion over all that is upon the earth, and in the seas, and over everything that flies, and over
beasts and over cattle, and over everything that moves on the earth, and over the whole earth, and
over all this He gave
    him dominion.  <LI>And these four kinds He created on the sixth day.  And there were
altogether
    two and twenty kinds.  <LI>And He finished all his work on the sixth day -all that is in the
heavens and on the earth, and in the seas and in the abysses, and in the light and in the darkness,
and in
    everything.  <LI>And He gave us a great sign, the Sabbath day, that we should work six
days, but 
     keep Sabbath on the seventh day from all work.  <LI>And all the angels of the presence, and
all the angels of sanctification, these two great classes -He hath bidden us to keep the Sabbath
with Him 
    in heaven and on earth.  <LI>And He said unto us:  'Behold, I will separate unto Myself a
people from among all the peoples, and these shall keep the Sabbath day, and I will sanctify them
unto Myself as My people, and will bless them; as I have sanctified the Sabbath day and do
sanctify (it) unto
    Myself, even so will I bless them, and they shall be My people and I will be their God. 
<LI>And I have chosen the seed of Jacob from amongst all that I have seen, and have written him
down as My first-born son,and have sanctified him unto Myself for ever and ever; and I will teach
them the 
    Sabbath day, that they may keep Sabbath thereon from all work.'  <LI>And thus He created
therein a sign in accordance with which they should keep Sabbath with us on the seventh day, to
eat and to drink, and to bless Him who has created all things as He has blessed and sanctified unto
Himself
    a peculiar people above all peoples, and that they should keep Sabbath together with
us.  <LI>And He caused His commands to ascend as a sweet savour acceptable before Him all the days
. . .
    <LI>There (were) two and twenty heads of mankind from Adam to Jacob, and two and
twenty kinds of work were made until the seventh day; this is blessed and holy; and the former
also is blessed and
     holy; and this one serves with that one for sanctification and blessing.  <LI>And to this
(Jacob and his seed) it was granted that they should always be the blessed and holy ones of the
first testimony
    and law, even as He had sanctified and blessed the Sabbath day on the seventh day.  <LI>He
created heaven and earth and everything that He created in six days, and God made the seventh
day holy, for all His works; therefore He commanded on its behalf that, whoever does any work
thereon
    shall die, and that he who defiles it shall surely die.  <LI>Wherefore do thou command the
children of Israel to observe this day that they may keep it holy and not do thereon any work, and
not to 
    defile it, as it is holier than all other days.  <LI>And whoever profanes it shall surely die, and
whoever does thereon any work shall surely die eternally, that the children of Israel may observe
this day throughout their generations, and not be rooted out of the land; for it is a holy day and a
blessed
    day.  <LI>And every one who observes it and keeps Sabbath thereon from all his work, will
be holy and 
    blessed throughout all days like unto us.  <LI>Declare and say to the children of Israel the
law of this day both that they should keep Sabbath thereon, and that they should not forsake it in
the error of their hearts; (and) that it is not lawful to do any work thereon which is unseemly, to
do thereon their own pleasure, and that they should not prepare thereon anything to be eaten or
drunk, and (that it is not lawful) to draw water, or bring in or take out thereon through their gates
any burden,
    which they had not prepared for themselves on the sixth day in their dwellings.  <LI>And
they shall not bring in nor take out from house to house on that day; for that day is more holy and
blessed than any jubilee day of the jubilees; on this we kept Sabbath in the heavens before it was
made
    known to any flesh to keep Sabbath thereon on the earth.  <LI>And the Creator of all things
blessed it, but he did not sanctify all peoples and nations to keep Sabbath thereon, but Israel
alone:  them
    alone he permitted to eat and drink and to keep Sabbath thereon on the earth.  <LI>And the
Creator of all things blessed this day which He had created for blessing and holiness and glory
above all
    days.  <LI>This law and testimony was given to the children of Israel as a law for ever unto
their generations.
