<p>[Chapter 16]
<OL>
    <LI>And on the new moon of the fourth month we appeared unto Abraham, at the oak of
Mamre, and we talked with him, and we announced to him that a son would be given to him by
Sarah his wife.  
    <LI>And Sarah laughed, for she heard that we had spoken these words with Abraham, and
we admonished 
    her, and she became afraid, and denied that she had laughed on account of the words. 
<LI>And we told her the name of her son, as his name is ordained and written in the heavenly tablets
(i.e.) Isaac, 
     <LI>And (that) when we returned to her at a set time, she would have conceived a son. 
<LI>And in this month the Lord executed his judgments on Sodom, and Gomorrah, and Zeboim, and
all the region of the Jordan, and He burned them with fire and brimstone, and destroyed them until
this day, even as [lo] I have declared unto thee all their works, that they are wicked and sinners
exceedingly, and that they defile themselves and commit fornication in their flesh, and work
uncleanness on the earth.  
    <LI>And, in like manner, God will execute judgment on the places where they have done
according to 
    the uncleanness of the Sodomites, like unto the judgment of Sodom.  <LI>But Lot we saved;
for God 
    remembered Abraham, and sent him out from the midst of the overthrow.  <LI>And he and
his daughters committed sin upon the earth, such as had not been on the earth since the days of
Adam till his 
    time; for the man lay with his daughters.  <LI>And, behold, it was commanded and engraven
concerning all his seed, on the heavenly tablets, to remove them and root them out, and to execute
judgment upon them like the judgment of Sodom, and to leave no seed of the man on earth on the
day 
    of condemnation.  <LI>And in this month Abraham moved from Hebron, and departed and
dwelt between 
    Kadesh and Shur in the mountains of Gerar.  <LI>And in the middle of the fifth month he
moved from 
    thence, and dwelt at the Well of the Oath.  <LI>And in the middle of the sixth month the
Lord visited 
    Sarah and did unto her as He had spoken and she conceived.  <LI>And she bare a son in the
third month, and in the middle of the month, at the time of which the Lord had spoken to
Abraham, on 
    the festival of the first fruits of the harvest, Isaac was born.  <LI>And Abraham circumcised
his son on the eighth day:  he was the first that was circumcised according to the covenant which
is ordained
    for ever.  <LI>And in the sixth year of the fourth week we came to Abraham, to the Well of
the Oath, and we appeared unto him [as we had told Sarah that we should return to her, and she
would have
    conceived a son.  <LI>And we returned in the seventh month, and found Sarah with child
before us] and we blessed him, and we announced to him all the things which had been decreed
concerning him, that he should not die till he should beget six sons more, and should see (them)
before he died; but
    (that) in Isaac should his name and seed be called:  <LI>And (that) all the seed of his sons
should be Gentiles, and be reckoned with the Gentiles; but from the sons of Isaac one should
become a holy
     seed, and should not be reckoned among the Gentiles.  <LI>For he should become the
portion of the Most High, and all his seed had fallen into the possession of God, that it should be
unto the Lord a people for (His) possession above all nations and that it should become a
kingdom and priests and
    a holy nation.  <LI>And we went our way, and we announced to Sarah all that we had told
him, and
    they both rejoiced with exceeding great joy.  <LI>And he built there an altar to the Lord
who had delivered him, and who was making him rejoice in the land of his sojourning, and he
celebrated a festival of joy in this month seven days, near the altar which he had built at the Well
of the Oath.
    <LI>And he built booths for himself and for his servants on this festival, and he was the first
to celebrate
    the feast of tabernacles on the earth.  <LI>And during these seven days he brought each day
to the altar a burnt offering to the Lord, two oxen, two rams, seven sheep, one he-goat, for a sin
offering,
    that he might atone thereby for himself and for his seed.  <LI>And, as a thank-offering,
seven rams, seven kids, seven sheep, and seven he-goats, and their fruit offerings and their drink
offerings; and he burnt all the fat thereof on the altar, a chosen offering unto the Lord for a sweet
smelling savour.
    <LI>And morning and evening he burnt fragrant substances, frankincense and galbanum,
and stackte, and nard, and myrrh, and spice, and costum; all these seven he offered, crushed,
mixed together in
    equal parts (and) pure.  <LI>And he celebrated this feast during seven days, rejoicing with
all his heart and with all his soul, he and all those who were in his house, and there was no
stranger with him,
    nor any that was uncircumcised.  <LI>And he blessed his Creator who had created him in
his generation, for He had created him according to His good pleasure; for He knew and
perceived that from him would arise the plant of righteousness for the eternal generations, and
from him a holy seed, so that it
    should become like Him who had made all things.  <LI>And he blessed and rejoiced, and he
called the
    name of this festival the festival of the Lord, a joy acceptable to the Most High God. 
<LI>And we blessed him for ever, and all his seed after him throughout all the generations of the earth,
because
    he celebrated this festival in its season, according to the testimony of the heavenly
tablets.  <LI>For this reason it is ordained on the heavenly tablets concerning Israel, that they shall
celebrate the feast of tabernacles seven days with joy, in the seventh month, acceptable before the
Lord -a statute for
    ever throughout their generations every year.  <LI>And to this there is no limit of days; for
it is ordained for ever regarding Israel that they should celebrate it and dwell in booths, and set
wreaths upon 
    their heads, and take leafy boughs, and willows from the brook.  <LI>And Abraham took
branches of palm trees, and the fruit of goodly trees, and every day going round the altar with the
branches seven times [a day] in the morning, he praised and gave thanks to his God for all things
in joy.
