<p>[Chapter 27]
<OL>
    <LI>And the words of Esau, her elder son, were told to Rebecca in a dream, and Rebecca
sent and 
    called Jacob her younger son, <LI>and said unto him:  'Behold Esau thy brother will take
vengeance on 
    thee so as to kill thee.  <LI>Now, therefore, my son, obey my voice, and arise and flee thou
to Laban, my brother, to Haran, and tarry with him a few days until thy brother's anger turns
away, and he remove his anger from thee, and forget all that thou hast done; then I will send and
fetch thee from 
     thence.'  <LI>And Jacob said:  'I am not afraid; if he wishes to kill me, I will kill him.'  <LI>But
she said 
    unto him:  'Let me not be bereft of both my sons on one day.'  <LI>And Jacob said to
Rebecca his mother:  'Behold, thou knowest that my father has become old, and does not see
because his eyes are dull, and if I leave him it will be evil in his eyes, because I leave him and go
away from you, and my father will be angry, and will curse me.  I will not go; when he sends me,
then only will I go.' 
     <LI>And Rebecca said to Jacob:  'I will go in and speak to him, and he will send thee
away.'  <LI>And Rebecca went in and said to Isaac:  'I loathe my life because of the two daughters of
Heth, whom Esau has taken him as wives; and if Jacob take a wife from among the daughters of
the land such 
    as these, for what purpose do I further live, for the daughters of Canaan are evil.'  <LI>And
Isaac called 
    Jacob and blessed him, and admonished him and said unto him:  'Do not take thee a
wife of any of the daughters of Canaan; <LI>arise and go to Mesopotamia, to the house of Bethuel,
thy mother's father, 
    and take thee a wife from thence of the daughters of Laban, thy mother's brother.  <LI>And
God Almighty bless thee and increase and multiply thee that thou mayest become a company of
nations, and give thee the blessings of my father Abraham, to thee and to thy seed after thee, that
thou mayest inherit the land of thy sojournings and all the land which God gave to Abraham:  go,
my 
    son, in peace.'  <LI>And Isaac sent Jacob away, and he went to Mesopotamia, to Laban the
son of 
    Bethuel the Syrian, the brother of Rebecca, Jacob's mother.  <LI>And it came to pass after
Jacob had 
    arisen to go to Mesopotamia that the spirit of Rebecca was grieved after her son, and
she wept.  <LI>And Isaac said to Rebecca:  'My sister, weep not on account of Jacob, my son; for he
goeth in peace, and
    in peace will he return.  <LI>The Most High God will preserve him from all evil, and will be
with him;
    for He will not forsake him all his days; <LI>For I know that his ways will be prospered in
all things
    wherever he goes, until he return in peace to us, and we see him in peace.  <LI>Fear not on
his account, my sister, for he is on the upright path and he is a perfect man:  and he is faithful and
will not perish.
    Weep not.'   <LI>And Isaac comforted Rebecca on account of her son Jacob, and blessed
him.  <LI>And Jacob went from the Well of the Oath to go to Haran on the first year of the second
week in the forty-fourth jubilee, and he came to Luz on the mountains, that is, Bethel, on the new
moon of the first month of this week, [2115 A.M.] and he came to the place at even and turned
from the way to the west of the
    road that night:  and he slept there; for the sun had set.  <LI>And he took one of the stones
of that
    place and laid &lt;it at his head&gt; under the tree, and he was journeying alone, and he
slept.  <LI>And he dreamt that night, and behold a ladder set up on the earth, and the top of it reached
to heaven, and behold, the angels of the Lord ascended and descended on it:  and behold, the
Lord stood upon it.
    <LI>And he spake to Jacob and said:  'I am the Lord God of Abraham, thy father, and the
God of
    Isaac; the land whereon thou art sleeping, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed after
thee.  <LI>And thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth, and thou shalt increase to the west and to the
east, to the
    north and the south, and in thee and in thy seed shall all the families of the nations be
blessed.  <LI>And behold, I will be with thee, and will keep thee whithersoever thou goest, and I will
bring thee again into this land in peace; for I will not leave thee until I do everything that I told
thee of.'
    <LI>And Jacob awoke from his sleep, and said, 'Truly this place is the house of the Lord,
and I knew it not.'  And he was afraid and said:  'Dreadful is this place which is none other than
the house of
    God, and this is the gate of heaven.'  <LI>And Jacob arose early in the morning, and took
the stone which he had put under his head and set it up as a pillar for a sign, and he poured oil
upon the top of it.  And he called the name of that place Bethel; but the name of the place was
Luz at the first.
    <LI>And Jacob vowed a vow unto the Lord, saying:  'If the Lord will be with me, and will
keep me in this way that I go, and give me bread to eat and raiment to put on, so that I come
again to my father's house in peace, then shall the Lord be my God, and this stone which I have
set up as a pillar for a sign in this place, shall be the Lord's house, and of all that thou givest me, I
shall give the tenth to thee, my God.'
