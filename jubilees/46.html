<blockquote><em>
Prosperity of Israel in Egypt, 1-2. Death of Joseph, 3-5. War between Egypt and Canaan during
which the bones of all the sons of Jacob except Joseph are buried at Hebron, 6-11. Egypt
oppresses Israel, 12-16. (Cf. Gen. l.22, 25-6; Exod. i.6-14.)

<p>[Chapter 46]
<OL>
    <LI>And it came to pass that after Jacob died the children of Israel multiplied in the land of
Egypt, and they became a great nation, and they were of one accord in heart, so that brother
loved brother and every man helped his brother, and they increased abundantly and multiplied
exceedingly, ten [2242 A.M.]
  weeks of years, all the days of the life of Joseph. <LI>And there was no Satan nor any evil all
the days of the life of Joseph which he lived after his father Jacob, for all the Egyptians honoured
the children
    of Israel all the days of the life of Joseph.  <LI>And Joseph died being a hundred and ten
years old; seventeen years he lived in the land of Canaan, and ten years he was a servant, and
three years in
    prison, and eighty years he was under the king, ruling all the land of Egypt.  <LI>And he died
and all
    his brethren and all that generation.  <LI>And he commanded the children of Israel before he
died that
    they should carry his bones with them when they went forth from the land of Egypt. 
<LI>And he made them swear regarding his bones, for he knew that the Egyptians would not again
bring forth and bury him in the land of Canaan, for Makamaron, king of Canaan, while dwelling in
the land of Assyria, fought in the valley with the king of Egypt and slew him there, and pursued
after the
    Egyptians to the gates of 'Ermon.  <LI>But he was not able to enter, for another, a new king,
had become king of Egypt, and he was stronger than he, and he returned to the land of Canaan,
and the gates of
    Egypt were closed, and none went out and none came into Egypt.  <LI>And Joseph died in
the forty-sixth jubilee, in the sixth week, in the second year, and they buried him in the land of
Egypt, and [2242 A.M.]
all his brethren died after him.   <LI>And the king of Egypt went forth to war with the king of
Canaan [2263 A.M.] in the forty-seventh jubilee, in the second week in the second year, and the
children of Israel brought forth all the bones of the children of Jacob save the bones of Joseph,
and they buried them in the
    field in the double cave in the mountain.  <LI>And the most (of them) returned to Egypt,
but a few of
    them remained in the mountains of Hebron, and Amram thy father remained with them. 
<LI>And the
    king of Canaan was victorious over the king of Egypt, and he closed the gates of
Egypt.  <LI>And he devised an evil device against the children of Israel of afflicting them and he said
unto the people of
    Egypt:  'Behold the people of the children of Israel have increased and multiplied more
than we.  <LI>Come and let us deal wisely with them before they become too many, and let us afflict
them with slavery before war come upon us and before they too fight against us; else they will join
themselves unto our enemies and get them up out of our land, for their hearts and faces are
towards the land
    of Canaan.'  <LI>And he set over them taskmasters to afflict them with slavery; and they
built strong cities for Pharaoh, Pithom, and Raamses and they built all the walls and all the
fortifications which 
    had fallen in the cities of Egypt.  <LI>And they made them serve with rigour, and the more
they dealt evilly with them, the more they increased and multiplied.  <LI>And the people of Egypt
abominated the children of Israel
