<blockquote><em>
Laws regarding the jubilees, 1-5, and the Sabbath, 6-13.
</em></blockquote>
<p>[Chapter 50]
<OL>
    <LI>And after this law I made known to thee the days of the Sabbaths in the desert of
Sin[ai], which 
    is between Elim and Sinai.  <LI>And I told thee of the Sabbaths of the land on Mount Sinai,
and I told thee of the jubilee years in the sabbaths of years:  but the year thereof have I not told
thee till ye
    enter the land which ye are to possess.  <LI>And the land also shall keep its sabbaths while
they dwell 
    upon it, and they shall know the jubilee year.  <LI>Wherefore I have ordained for thee the
year-weeks and the years and the jubilees:  there are forty-nine jubilees from the days of Adam
until this day, [2410 A.M.] and one week and two years:  and there are yet forty years to come
(lit. 'distant') for learning the [2450 A.M.] commandments of the Lord, until they pass over into
the land of Canaan, crossing the Jordan to the
    west.  <LI>And the jubilees shall pass by, until Israel is cleansed from all guilt of fornication,
and uncleanness, and pollution, and sin, and error, and dwells with confidence in all the land, and
there shall be no more a Satan or any evil one, and the land shall be clean from that time for
evermore.
    <LI>And behold the commandment regarding the Sabbaths -I have written (them) down for
thee-
    and all the judgments of its laws.  <LI>Six days shalt thou labour, but on the seventh day is
the Sabbath of the Lord your God.  In it ye shall do no manner of work, ye and your sons, and
your men-
    servants and your maid-servants, and all your cattle and the sojourner also who is with
you.  <LI>And the man that does any work on it shall die:  whoever desecrates that day, whoever lies
with (his) wife, or whoever says he will do something on it, that he will set out on a journey
thereon in regard to any buying or selling:  and whoever draws water thereon which he had not
prepared for himself on the sixth day, and whoever takes up any burden to carry it out of his tent
or out of his house
    shall die.  <LI>Ye shall do no work whatever on the Sabbath day save what ye have prepared
for yourselves on the sixth day, so as to eat, and drink, and rest, and keep Sabbath from all work
on that day, and to bless the Lord your God, who has given you a day of festival and a holy day: 
and
    a day of the holy kingdom for all Israel is this day among their days for ever.  <LI>For great
is the honour which the Lord has given to Israel that they should eat and drink and be satisfied on
this festival day, and rest thereon from all labour which belongs to the labour of the children of
men save burning frankincense and bringing oblations and sacrifices before the Lord for days and
for
    Sabbaths.  <LI>This work alone shall be done on the Sabbath-days in the sanctuary of the
Lord your God; that they may atone for Israel with sacrifice continually from day to day for a
memorial well-pleasing before the Lord, and that He may receive them always from day to day
according as thou
    hast been commanded.  <LI>And every man who does any work thereon, or goes a journey,
or tills (his) farm, whether in his house or any other place, and whoever lights a fire, or rides on
any beast, or travels by ship on the sea, and whoever strikes or kills anything, or slaughters a beast
or a bird, or
    whoever catches an animal or a bird or a fish, or whoever fasts or makes war on the
Sabbaths:  <LI>The man who does any of these things on the Sabbath shall die, so that the children of
Israel shall observe the Sabbaths according to the commandments regarding the Sabbaths of the
land, as it is written in the tablets, which He gave into my hands that I should write out for thee
the laws of the seasons, and the seasons according to the division of their days.
<P>
     Herewith is completed the account of the division of the days.
