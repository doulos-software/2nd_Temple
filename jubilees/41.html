<blockquote><em>
Judah's sons and Tamar, 1-7. Judah's incest with Tamar, 8-18. Tamar bears twins, 21-2.
Judah forgiven, because he sinned ignorantly and repented when convicted, and because Tamar's

<p>[Chapter 41]
<OL>
    <LI>And in the forty-fifth jubilee, in the second week, (and) in the second year, [2165 A.M.]
Judah took for his 
    first-born Er, a wife from the daughters of Aram, named Tamar.  <LI>But he hated, and did
not lie with her, because his mother was of the daughters of Canaan, and he wished to take him a
wife of the
    kinsfolk of his mother, but Judah, his father, would not permit him.  <LI>And this Er, the
first-born of Judah,
    was wicked, and the Lord slew him.  <LI>And Judah said unto Onan, his brother 'Go in unto
thy brother's wife and perform the duty of a husband's brother unto her, and raise up seed unto thy
brother.'  <LI>And
    Onan knew that the seed would not be his, (but) his brother's only, and he went into the
house of his brother's wife, and spilt the seed on the ground, and he was wicked in the eyes of the
Lord, and He slew
    him.  <LI>And Judah said unto Tamar, his daughter-in-law:  'Remain in thy father's house as
a widow till 
    Shelah my son be grown up, and I shall give thee to him to wife.'  <LI>And he grew up; but
Bedsu'el, the wife of Judah, did not permit her son Shelah to marry.  And Bedsu'el, the wife of
Judah, died [2168 A.M.]
in the fifth year of this week.  <LI>And in the sixth year Judah went up to shear his sheep at
Timnah. [2169 A.M.]
And they told Tamar:  'Behold thy father-in-law goeth up to Timnah to shear his sheep.' 
<LI>And she put off her widow's clothes, and put on a veil, and adorned herself, and sat in the gate
adjoining the
   way to Timnah.   <LI>And as Judah was going along he found her, and thought her to be an
harlot, and he said unto her:  'Let me come in unto thee'; and she said unto him Come in,' and he
went
    in.  <LI>And she said unto him:  'Give me my hire'; and he said unto her:  'I have nothing in
my 
   hand save my ring that is on my finger, and my necklace, and my staff which is in my
hand.'   <LI>And she said unto him 'Give them to me until thou dost send me my hire', and he said unto
her:  'I will send unto thee a kid of the goats'; and he gave them to her, <em>and he went in unto her</em>,
and 
     she conceived by him.  <LI>And Judah went unto his sheep, and she went to her father's
house.  <LI>And Judah sent a kid of the goats by the hand of his shepherd, an Adullamite, and he
found her not; and he asked the people of the place, saying:  'Where is the harlot who was here?' 
And they said
    unto him; 'There is no harlot here with us.'  <LI>And he returned and informed him, and said
unto him that he had not found her:  'I asked the people of the place, and they said unto me: 
"There
    is no harlot here." '  <LI>And he said:  'Let her keep (them) lest we become a cause of
derision.'  And when she had completed three months, it was manifest that she was with child, and
they told Judah,
    saying:  'Behold Tamar, thy daughter-in-law, is with child by whoredom.'  <LI>And Judah
went to the house of her father, and said unto her father and her brothers:  'Bring her forth, and let
them burn
     her, for she hath wrought uncleanness in Israel.'  <LI>And it came to pass when they
brought her forth to burn her that she sent to her father-in-law the ring and the necklace, and the
staff, saying:  
    'Discern whose are these, for by him am I with child.' <LI>And Judah acknowledged, and
said:  'Tamar 
    is more righteous than I am.  <LI>And therefore let them burn her not'  And for that reason
she was
   not given to Shelah, and he did not again approach her.  <LI>And after that she bare two
sons, Perez [2170 A.M.]
and Zerah, in the seventh year of this second week.  <LI>And thereupon the seven years of
fruitfulness 
   were accomplished, of which Joseph spake to Pharaoh.   <LI>And Judah acknowledged that
the deed which he had done was evil, for he had lain with his daughter-in-law, and he esteemed it
hateful in his eyes, and he acknowledged that he had transgressed and gone astray, for he had
uncovered the skirt of his son, and he began to lament and to supplicate before the Lord because
of his transgression.
    <LI>And we told him in a dream that it was forgiven him because he supplicated earnestly,
and lamented, 
    and did not again commit it.  <LI>And he received forgiveness because he turned from his
sin and from his ignorance, for he transgressed greatly before our God; and every one that acts
thus, every one who lies with his mother-in-law, let them burn him with fire that he may burn
therein, for there is
    uncleanness and pollution upon them, with fire let them burn them.  <LI>And do thou
command the children of Israel that there be no uncleanness amongst them, for every one who lies
with his daughter-in-law or with his mother-in-law hath wrought uncleanness; with fire let them
burn the man who has lain with her, and likewise the woman, and He will turn away wrath and
punishment
    from Israel.  <LI>And unto Judah we said that his two sons had not lain with her, and for
this reason 
    his seed was stablished for a second generation, and would not be rooted out.  <LI>For in
singleness of eye he had gone and sought for punishment, namely, according to the judgment of
Abraham, which he had commanded his sons, Judah had sought to burn her with fire.
