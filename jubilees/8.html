<p>[Chapter 8]
<OL>
    <LI>In the twenty-ninth jubilee, in the first week, [1373 A.M.] in the beginning thereof
Arpachshad took to himself a wife and her name was Rasu'eja, the daughter of Susan, the
daughter of Elam, and she
    bare him a son in the third year in this week, [1375 A.M.] and he called his name
Kainam.  <LI>And the son grew, and his father taught him writing, and he went to seek for himself a
place where he might seize for
    himself a city.  <LI>And he found a writing which former (generations) had carved on the
rock, and he read what was thereon, and he transcribed it and sinned owing to it; for it contained
the teaching of the Watchers in accordance with which they used to observe the omens of the sun
and moon and
    stars in all the signs of heaven.  <LI>And he wrote it down and said nothing regarding it; for
he was
    afraid to speak to Noah about it lest he should be angry with him on account of it.  <LI>And
in the thirtieth jubilee, [1429 A.M.] in the second week, in the first year thereof, he took to
himself a wife, and her name was Melka, the daughter of Madai, the son of Japheth, and in the
fourth year [1432 A.M.] he begat a son, and 
    called his name Shelah; for he said:  'Truly I have been sent.'  <LI>[And in the fourth year he
was born], and Shelah grew up and took to himself a wife, and her name was Mu'ak, the daughter
of Kesed, his father's brother, in the one and thirtieth jubilee, in the fifth week, in the first year
[1499 A.M.]
    thereof.  <LI>And she bare him a son in the fifth year [1503 A.M.] thereof, and he called his
name Eber:  and he took unto himself a wife, and her name was 'Az&ucirc;r&acirc;d, the daughter of Nebrod,
in the thirty-second 
    jubilee, in the seventh week, in the third year thereof. [1564 A.M.]  <LI>And in the sixth year
[1567 A.M.] thereof, she bare him  son, and he called his name Peleg; for in the days when he was
born the children of Noah began 
    to divide the earth amongst themselves:  for this reason he called his name Peleg.  <LI>And
they 
    divided (it) secretly amongst themselves, and told it to Noah.  <LI>And it came to pass in
the beginning of the thirty-third jubilee [1569 A.M.] that they divided the earth into three parts,
for Shem and Ham and Japheth, according to the inheritance of each, in the first year in the first
week, when one of us 
    who had been sent, was with them.  <LI>And he called his sons, and they drew nigh to him,
they and their children, and he divided the earth into the lots, which his three sons were to take in
possession, and they reached forth their hands, and took the writing out of the bosom of Noah,
their father.  
    <LI>And there came forth on the writing as Shem's lot the middle of the earth which he
should take as an inheritance for himself and for his sons for the generations of eternity, from the
middle of the mountain range of Rafa, from the mouth of the water from the river Tina, and his
portion goes towards the west through the midst of this river, and it extends till it reaches the
water of the abysses, out of which this river goes forth and pours its waters into the sea Me'at,
and this river flows into the great sea.  And all that is towards the north is Japheth's, and all that is
towards the 
    south belongs to Shem.  <LI>And it extends till it reaches Karaso:  this is in the bosom of
the tongue
    which looks towards the south.  <LI>And his portion extends along the great sea, and it
extends in a straight line till it reaches the west of the tongue which looks towards the south:  for
this sea is 
    named the tongue of the Egyptian Sea.  <LI>And it turns from here towards the south
towards the mouth of the great sea on the shore of (its) waters, and it extends to the west to
'Afra, and it extends till it reaches the waters of the river Gihon, and to the south of the waters of
Gihon, to the
    banks of this river.  <LI>And it extends towards the east, till it reaches the Garden of Eden,
to the south thereof, [to the south] and from the east of the whole land of Eden and of the whole
east, it turns to the east and proceeds till it reaches the east of the mountain named Rafa, and it
descends 
    to the bank of the mouth of the river Tina.  <LI>This portion came forth by lot for Shem
and his sons,
     that they should possess it for ever unto his generations for evermore.  <LI>And Noah
rejoiced that this portion came forth for Shem and for his sons, and he remembered all that he had
spoken with his mouth in prophecy; for he had said:  
     'Blessed be the Lord God of Shem 
     And may the Lord dwell in the dwelling of Shem.'
    <LI>And he knew that the Garden of Eden is the holy of holies, and the dwelling of the
Lord, and Mount Sinai the centre of the desert, and Mount Zion -the centre of the navel of the
earth:  these three
    were created as holy places facing each other.  <LI>And he blessed the God of gods, who
had put the
    word of the Lord into his mouth, and the Lord for evermore.  <LI>And he knew that a
blessed portion and a blessing had come to Shem and his sons unto the generations for ever -the
whole land of Eden and the whole land of the Red Sea, and the whole land of the east and India,
and on the Red Sea and the mountains thereof, and all the land of Bashan, and all the land of
Lebanon and the islands of Kaftur, and all the mountains of Sanir and 'Amana, and the mountains
of Asshur in the north, and all the land of Elam, Asshur, and Babel, and Susan and Ma'edai, and
all the mountains of Ararat, and all the region beyond the sea, which is beyond the mountains of
Asshur towards the
    north, a blessed and spacious land, and all that is in it is very good.  <LI>And for Ham came
forth the second portion, beyond the Gihon towards the south to the right of the Garden, and it
extends towards the south and it extends to all the mountains of fire, and it extends towards the
west to the sea of 'Atel and it extends towards the west till it reaches the sea of Ma'uk -that (sea)
into which
    everything which is not destroyed descends.  <LI>And it goes forth towards the north to the
limits of Gadir, and it goes forth to the coast of the waters of the sea to the waters of the great sea
till it draws near to the river Gihon, and goes along the river Gihon till it reaches the right of the
Garden
    of Eden.  <LI>And this is the land which came forth for Ham as the portion which he was to
occupy
    for ever for himself and his sons unto their generations for ever.  <LI>And for Japheth came
forth the third portion beyond the river Tina to the north of the outflow of its waters, and it
extends north-
    easterly to the whole region of Gog, and to all the country east thereof.  <LI>And it extends
northerly to the north, and it extends to the mountains of Qelt towards the north, and towards the
sea of
    Ma'uk, and it goes forth to the east of Gadir as far as the region of the waters of the
sea.  <LI>And it extends until it approaches the west of Fara and it returns towards 'Aferag, and it
extends easterly
    to the waters of the sea of Me'at.  <LI>And it extends to the region of the river Tina in a
north-easterly direction until it approaches the boundary of its waters towards the mountain Rafa,
and it turns
    round towards the north.  <LI>This is the land which came forth for Japheth and his sons as
the portion of his inheritance which he should possess for himself and his sons, for their
generations for ever; 
    five great islands, and a great land in the north.  <LI>But it is cold, and the land of Ham is
hot, and the land of Shem is neither hot nor cold, but it is of blended cold and heat.
