<p>[Chapter 13]
<OL>
    <LI>And Abram journeyed from Haran, and he took Sarai, his wife, and Lot, his brother
Haran's son, to the land of Canaan, and he came into Asshur, and proceeded to Shechem, and
dwelt near
    a lofty oak.  <LI>And he saw, and, behold, the land was very pleasant from the entering of
Hamath to 
    the lofty oak.  <LI>And the Lord said to him:  'To thee and to thy seed will I give this land.' 
<LI>And 
    he built an altar there, and he offered thereon a burnt sacrifice to the Lord, who had
appeared to
    him.  <LI>And he removed from thence unto the mountain . . . Bethel on the west and Ai on
the 
    east, and pitched his tent there.  <LI>And he saw and behold, the land was very wide and
good, and everything grew thereon -vines and figs and pomegranates, oaks and ilexes, and
terebinths and oil trees, and cedars and cypresses and date trees, and all trees of the field, and
there was water on the 
    mountains.  <LI>And he blessed the Lord who had led him out of Ur of the Chaldees, and
had brought
    him to this land.  <LI>And it came to pass in the first year, in the seventh week, on the new
moon of the first month, 1954 A.M.] that he built an altar on this mountain, and called on the
name of the Lord:  'Thou,
    the eternal God, art my God.'  <LI>And he offered on the altar a burnt sacrifice unto the Lord
that He 
    should be with him and not forsake him all the days of his life.  <LI>And he removed from
thence and went towards the south, and he came to Hebron and Hebron was built at that time,
and he dwelt there two years, and he went (thence) into the land of the south, to Bealoth, and
there was a famine 
    in the land.  <LI>And Abram went into Egypt in the third year of the week, and he dwelt in
Egypt 
    five years before his wife was torn away from him.  <LI>Now Tanais in Egypt was at that
time built-
    seven years after Hebron.  <LI>And it came to pass when Pharaoh seized Sarai, the wife of
Abram that the Lord plagued Pharaoh and his house with great plagues because of Sarai, Abram's
wife.
    <LI>And Abram was very glorious by reason of possessions in sheep, and cattle, and asses,
and horses, and camels, and menservants, and maidservants, and in silver and gold exceedingly. 
And Lot also
    his brother's son, was wealthy.  <LI>And Pharaoh gave back Sarai, the wife of Abram, and
he sent him out of the land of Egypt, and he journeyed to the place where he had pitched his tent
at the beginning, to the place of the altar, with Ai on the east, and Bethel on the west, and he
blessed the
    Lord his God who had brought him back in peace.  <LI>And it came to pass in the
forty-first jubilee in the third year of the first week, [1963 A.M.] that he returned to this place and
offered thereon a burnt sacrifice, and called on the name of the Lord, and said:  'Thou, the most
high God, art my God for ever
    and ever.'  <LI>And in the fourth year of this week [1964 A.M.] Lot parted from him, and
Lot dwelt in Sodom, and 
     the men of Sodom were sinners exceedingly.  <LI>And it grieved him in his heart that his
brother's 
    son had parted from him; for he had no children.  <LI>In that year when Lot was taken
captive, the Lord said unto Abram, after that Lot had parted from him, in the fourth year of this
week:  'Lift up thine eyes from the place where thou art dwelling, northward and southward, and
westward and
    eastward.  <LI>For all the land which thou seest I will give to thee and to thy seed for ever,
and I will make thy seed as the sand of the sea:  though a man may number the dust of the earth,
yet
    thy seed shall not be numbered.  <LI>Arise, walk (through the land) in the length of it and
the breadth of it, and see it all; for to thy seed will I give it.'  And Abram went to Hebron, and
dwelt there.
    <LI>And in this year came Chedorlaomer, king of Elam, and Amraphel, king of Shinar, and
Arioch king of Sellasar, and Tergal, king of nations, and slew the king of Gomorrah, and the king
of Sodom
    fled, and many fell through wounds in the vale of Siddim, by the Salt Sea.  <LI>And they
took captive Sodom and Adam and Zeboim, and they took captive Lot also, the son of Abram's
brother, and
    all his possessions, and they went to Dan.  <LI>And one who had escaped came and told
Abram that
    his brother's son had been taken captive and (Abram) armed his household servants . . .

     <LI>. . . . for Abram, and for his seed, a tenth of the first fruits to the Lord, and the Lord
ordained it as an ordinance for ever that they should give it to the priests
    who served before Him, that they should possess it for ever.  <LI>And to this law there is
no limit of days; for He hath ordained it for the generations for ever that they should give to the
Lord the tenth of everything, of the seed and of the wine and of the oil and of the cattle and of the
sheep.
     <LI>And He gave (it) unto His priests to eat and to drink with joy before Him.  <LI>And the
king of Sodom came to him and bowed himself before him, and said:  'Our Lord Abram, give unto
us the
    souls which thou hast rescued, but let the booty be thine.'  <LI>And Abram said unto him: 
'I lift up my hands to the Most High God, that from a thread to a shoe-latchet I shall not take
aught that is thine lest thou shouldst say, I have made Abram rich; save only what the young men
have eaten, and the portion of the men who went with me -Aner, Eschol, and Mamre.  These shall
take their portion.'
