<p>[Chapter 47]
<OL>
    <LI>And in the seventh week, in the seventh year, in the forty-seventh jubilee, thy father
went forth [2303 A.M.] from the land of Canaan, and thou wast born in the fourth week, in the
sixth year thereof, in the [2330 A.M.]
    forty-eighth jubilee; this was the time of tribulation on the children of Israel.  <LI>And
Pharaoh, king of Egypt, issued a command regarding them that they should cast all their male
children which were 
    born into the river.  <LI>And they cast them in for seven months until the day that thou wast
born 
    <LI>And thy mother hid thee for three months, and they told regarding her.  And she made
an ark for thee, and covered it with pitch and asphalt, and placed it in the flags on the bank of the
river, and she placed thee in it seven days, and thy mother came by night and suckled thee, and by
day
    Miriam, thy sister, guarded thee from the birds.  <LI>And in those days Tharmuth, the
daughter of Pharaoh, came to bathe in the river, and she heard thy voice crying, and she told her
maidens to
    bring thee forth, and they brought thee unto her.  <LI>And she took thee out of the ark, and
she had
    compassion on thee.  <LI>And thy sister said unto her:  'Shall I go and call unto thee one of
the
    Hebrew women to nurse and suckle this babe for thee?'  <LI>And she said &lt;unto her&gt;:  'Go.' 
And she
    went and called thy mother Jochebed, and she gave her wages, and she nursed thee. 
<LI>And afterwards, when thou wast grown up, they brought thee unto the daughter of Pharaoh, and
thou didst become her son, and Amram thy father taught thee writing, and after thou hadst
completed three weeks
    they brought thee into the royal court.  <LI>And thou wast three weeks of years at court
until the time [2351-] when thou didst go forth from the royal court and didst see an Egyptian
smiting thy friend who was [2372 A.M.]
    of the children of Israel, and thou didst slay him and hide him in the sand.  <LI>And on the
second day thou didst and two of the children of Israel striving together, and thou didst say to him
who was 
    doing the wrong:  'Why dost thou smite thy brother?'  <LI>And he was angry and indignant,
and said:  'Who made thee a prince and a judge over us?  Thinkest thou to kill me as thou killedst
the Egyptian yesterday?'  And thou didst fear and flee on account of these words.
