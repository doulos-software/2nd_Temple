<p>[Chapter 45]
<OL>
    <LI> And Israel went into the country of Egypt, into the land of Goshen, on the new moon of
the fourth [2172 A.M]. 
    month, in the second year of the third week of the forty-fifth jubilee.  <LI>And Joseph went
to meet his
    father Jacob, to the land of Goshen, and he fell on his father's neck and wept.  <LI>And Israel
said unto Joseph:  'Now let me die since I have seen thee, and now may the Lord God of Israel be
blessed the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac who hath not withheld His mercy and His grace
from
    His servant Jacob.  <LI>It is enough for me that I have seen thy face whilst I am yet alive;
yea, true is the vision which I saw at Bethel.  Blessed be the Lord my God for ever and ever, and
blessed be
    His name.'  <LI>And Joseph and his brothers eat bread before their father and drank wine,
and Jacob rejoiced with exceeding great joy because he saw Joseph eating with his brothers and
drinking before him, and he blessed the Creator of all things who had preserved him, and had
preserved for him his
    twelve sons.  <LI>And Joseph had given to his father and to his brothers as a gift the right of
dwelling in the land of Goshen and in Rameses and all the region round about, which he ruled
over before Pharaoh.  And Israel and his sons dwelt in the land of Goshen, the best part of the
land of Egypt
    and Israel was one hundred and thirty years old when he came into Egypt.  <LI>And Joseph
nourished his father and his brethren and also their possessions with bread as much as sufficed
them for the
    seven years of the famine.  <LI>And the land of Egypt suffered by reason of the famine, and
Joseph acquired all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh in return for food, and he got possession of the
people
    and their cattle and everything for Pharaoh.  <LI>And the years of the famine were
accomplished, and Joseph gave to the people in the land seed and food that they might sow (the
land) in the eighth
   year, for the river had overflowed all the land of Egypt.   <LI>For in the seven years of the
famine it had (not) overflowed and had irrigated only a few places on the banks of the river, but
now it overflowed
    and the Egyptians sowed the land, and it bore much corn that year.  <LI>And this was the
first year of [2178 A.M.]
   the fourth week of the forty-fifth jubilee.  <LI>And Joseph took of the corn of the harvest
the fifth part for the king and left four parts for them for food and for seed, and Joseph made it an
ordinance for
    the land of Egypt until this day.  <LI>And Israel lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years,
and all the days which he lived were three jubilees, one hundred and forty-seven years, and he
died in the fourth [2188 A.M.]
year of the fifth week of the forty-fifth jubilee.  <LI>And Israel blessed his sons before he
died and told them everything that would befall them in the land of Egypt; and he made known to
them what would come upon them in the last days, and blessed them and gave to Joseph two
portions in
    the land.  <LI>And he slept with his fathers, and he was buried in the double cave in the land
of Canaan, near Abraham his father in the grave which he dug for himself in the double cave
in
    the land of Hebron.  <LI>And he gave all his books and the books of his fathers to Levi his
son that he might preserve them and renew them for his children until this day.
