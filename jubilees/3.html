<p>[Chapter 3]
<OL>
    <LI>And on the six days of the second week we brought, according to the word of God,
unto Adam all the beasts, and all the cattle, and all the birds, and everything that moves on the
earth, and everything that moves in the water, according to their kinds, and according to their
types:  the beasts on the first day; the cattle on the second day; the birds on the third day; and all
that which moves on the earth on the fourth day; and that which moves in the water on the fifth
day.
    <LI>And Adam named them all by their respective names, and as he called them, so was their
name.
    <LI>And on these five days Adam saw all these, male and female, according to every kind
that was on
    the earth, but he was alone and found no helpmeet for him.  <LI>And the Lord said unto us: 
'It is not
    good that the man should be alone:  let us make a helpmeet for him.'  <LI>And the Lord our
God caused a deep sleep to fall upon him, and he slept, and He took for the woman one rib from
amongst
    his ribs, and this rib was the origin of the woman from amongst his ribs, and He built up
the flesh in its stead, and built the woman.  <LI>And He awaked Adam out of his sleep and on
awaking he rose on the sixth day, and He brought her to him, and he knew her, and said unto her: 
'This is now bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh; she shall be called
    [my] wife; because she was taken from her husband.' <LI>Therefore shall man and wife be
one and therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and cleave unto his wife, and they
shall be
    one flesh.  <LI>In the first week was Adam created, and the rib -his wife:  in the second week
He showed her unto him:  and for this reason the commandment was given to keep in their
defilement,
    for a male seven days, and for a female twice seven days.  <LI>And after Adam had
completed forty days in the land where he had been created, we brought him into the garden of
Eden to till and keep it, but his wife they brought in on the eightieth day, and after this she entered
into the garden
    of Eden.  <LI>And for this reason the commandment is written on the heavenly tablets in
regard to her that gives birth:  'if she bears a male, she shall remain in her uncleanness seven days
according to the first week of days, and thirty and three days shall she remain in the blood of her
purifying, and she shall not touch any hallowed thing, nor enter into the sanctuary, until she
accomplishes these
    days which (are enjoined) in the case of a male child.  <LI>But in the case of a female child
she shall remain in her uncleanness two weeks of days, according to the first two weeks, and
sixty-six days 
    in the blood of her purification, and they will be in all eighty days.'  <LI>And when she had
completed these eighty days we brought her into the garden of Eden, for it is holier than all the
earth besides and 
    every tree that is planted in it is holy.  <LI>Therefore, there was ordained regarding her who
bears a male or a female child the statute of those days that she should touch no hallowed thing,
nor 
    enter into the sanctuary until these days for the male or female child are accomplished. 
<LI>This is the law and testimony which was written down for Israel, in order that they should observe
(it) all the 
    days.  <LI>And in the first week of the first jubilee, [1-7 A.M.] Adam and his wife were in
the garden of Eden for seven years tilling and keeping it, and we gave him work and we instructed
him to do everything
    that is suitable for tillage.  <LI>And he tilled (the garden), and was naked and knew it not,
and was not ashamed, and he protected the garden from the birds and beasts and cattle, and
gathered its fruit, and eat, and put aside the residue for himself and for his wife [and put aside that
which was
    being kept].  <LI>And after the completion of the seven years, which he had completed
there, seven years exactly, [8 A.M.] and in the second month, on the seventeenth day (of the
month), the serpent came and approached the woman, and the serpent said to the woman, 'Hath
God commanded you,
     saying, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden?' <LI>And she said to it, 'Of all the fruit
of the trees of the garden God hath said unto us, Eat; but of the fruit of the tree which is in the
midst of the garden God hath said unto us, Ye shall not eat thereof, neither shall ye touch it, lest
ye die.'  <LI>And the serpent said unto the woman, 'Ye shall not surely die:  for God doth know that
on the day ye shall eat thereof, your eyes will be opened, and ye will be as gods, and ye will know
good and
    evil.  <LI>And the woman saw the tree that it was agreeable and pleasant to the eye, and
that its fruit
    was good for food, and she took thereof and eat.  <LI>And when she had first covered her
shame with figleaves, she gave thereof to Adam and he eat, and his eyes were opened, and he saw
that he was
    naked.  <LI>And he took figleaves and sewed (them) together, and made an apron for
himself, and
     ,covered his shame.  <LI>And God cursed the serpent, and was wroth with it for ever . .
.  <LI>And He was wroth with the woman, because she harkened to the voice of the serpent, and did
eat; and He said unto her:  'I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy pains:  in sorrow thou shalt
bring forth
    children, and thy return shall be unto thy husband, and he will rule over thee.'  <LI>And to
Adam also he said, ' Because thou hast harkened unto the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the
tree of which I commanded thee that thou shouldst not eat thereof, cursed be the ground for thy
sake:  thorns and thistles shall it bring forth to thee, and thou shalt eat thy bread in the sweat of
thy face, till thou returnest to the earth from whence thou wast taken; for earth thou art, and unto
earth shalt
    thou return.'  <LI>And He made for them coats of skin, and clothed them, and sent them
forth from
    the Garden of Eden.  <LI>And on that day on which Adam went forth from the Garden, he
offered as a sweet savour an offering, frankincense, galbanum, and stacte, and spices in the
morning with the
    rising of the sun from the day when he covered his shame.  <LI>And on that day was closed
the mouth of all beasts, and of cattle, and of birds, and of whatever walks, and of whatever
moves, so that they could no longer speak:  for they had all spoken one with another with one lip
and with one tongue.
    <LI>And He sent out of the Garden of Eden all flesh that was in the Garden of Eden, and all
flesh was scattered according to its kinds, and according to its types unto the places which had
been created
    for them.  <LI>And to Adam alone did He give (the wherewithal) to cover his shame, of all
the beasts and
    cattle.  <LI>On this account, it is prescribed on the heavenly tablets as touching all those
who know the judgment of the law, that they should cover their shame, and should not uncover
themselves as the
    Gentiles uncover themselves.  <LI>And on the new moon of the fourth month, Adam and
his wife went
    forth from the Garden of Eden, and they dwelt in the land of Elda in the land of their
creation.  <LI>And
    Adam called the name of his wife Eve.  <LI>And they had no son till the first jubilee, [8
A.M.] and after this he
    knew her.  <LI>Now he tilled the land as he had been instructed in the Garden of Eden.
