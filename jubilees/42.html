<blockquote><em>
Owing to the famine Jacob sends his sons to Egypt for corn, 1-4. Joseph recognizes them and retains
Simeon, and requires them to bring Benjamin when they returned, 5-12. Notwithstanding
Jacob's reluctance his sons take Benjamin with them on their second journey and are entertained
by Joseph, 13-25. (Cf. Gen. xli.54, 56; xlii.7-9, 13, 17, 20, 24-5, 29-30, 34-8; xliii.1-2, 4-5,
8-9, 11, 15, 23, 26, 29, 34; xliv. 1-2.)

<p>[Chapter 42]
<OL>
    <LI>And in the first year of the third week of the forty-fifth jubilee the famine began to come
into the [2171 A.M.]
  land, and the rain refused to be given to the earth, for none whatever fell.  <LI>And the earth
grew barren, but in the land of Egypt there was food, for Joseph had gathered the seed of the land
in the
    seven years of plenty and had preserved it.  <LI>And the Egyptians came to Joseph that he
might give them food, and he opened the store-houses where was the grain of the first year, and
he sold it to
    the people of the land for gold.  <LI>&lt;Now the famine was very sore in the land of Canaan&gt;,
and Jacob heard that there was food in Egypt, and he sent his ten sons that they should procure
food for him in Egypt; but Benjamin he did not send, and &lt;the ten sons of Jacob&gt; arrived &lt;in
Egypt&gt; among those
    that went (there).  <LI>And Joseph recognised them, but they did not recognise him, and he
spake unto them and questioned them, and he said unto them; 'Are ye not spies and have ye not
come to
    explore the approaches of the land?  'And he put them in ward.  <LI>And after that he set
them free
    again, and detained Simeon alone and sent off his nine brothers.  <LI>And he filled their
sacks with corn,
    and he put their gold in their sacks, and they did not know.  <LI>And he commanded them to
bring
    their younger brother, for they had told him their father was living and their younger
brother.  <LI>And they went up from the land of Egypt and they came to the land of Canaan; and they
told their father all that had befallen them, and how the lord of the country had spoken roughly to
them, and
    had seized Simeon till they should bring Benjamin.  <LI>And Jacob said:  'Me have ye
bereaved of my children!  Joseph is not and Simeon also is not, and ye will take Benjamin away. 
On me has your
    wickedness come.  <LI>'And he said:  'My son will not go down with you lest perchance he
fall sick; for their mother gave birth to two sons, and one has perished, and this one also ye will
take from me.  If perchance he took a fever on the road, ye would bring down my old age with
sorrow unto death.'
    <LI>For he saw that their money had been returned to every man in his sack, and for this
reason he
    feared to send him.  <LI>And the famine increased and became sore in the land of Canaan,
and in all lands save in the land of Egypt, for many of the children of the Egyptians had stored up
their seed for food from the time when they saw Joseph gathering seed together and putting it in
storehouses
    and preserving it for the years of famine.  <LI>And the people of Egypt fed themselves
thereon during
    the first year of their famine. <LI>But when Israel saw that the famine was very sore in the
land, and that there was no deliverance, he said unto his sons:  'Go again, and procure food for us
that we die
    not.'  <LI>And they said:  'We shall not go; unless our youngest brother go with us, we shall
not go.'
    <LI>And Israel saw that if he did not send him with them, they should all perish by reason
of the famine
     <LI>And Reuben said:  'Give him into my hand, and if I do not bring him back to thee, slay
my two
    sons instead of his soul.'  <LI>And he said unto him:  'He shall not go with thee.'  And Judah
came near and said:  'Send him with me, and if I do not bring him back to thee, let me bear the
blame before
   thee all the days of my life.'   <LI>And he sent him with them in the second year of this week
on the [2172 A.m.] first day of the month, and they came to the land of Egypt with all those who
went, and (they had)
    presents in their hands, stacte and almonds and terebinth nuts and pure honey.  <LI>And
they went and stood before Joseph, and he saw Benjamin his brother, and he knew him, and said
unto them:  Is this your youngest brother?'  And they said unto him:  'It is he.'  And he said The
Lord be
    gracious to thee, my son!'  <LI>And he sent him into his house and he brought forth Simeon
unto them and he made a feast for them, and they presented to him the gift which they had
brought in their
    hands.  <LI>And they eat before him and he gave them all a portion, but the portion of
Benjamin was
   seven times larger than that of any of theirs.   <LI>And they eat and drank and arose and
remained with
    their asses.  <LI>And Joseph devised a plan whereby he might learn their thoughts as to
whether thoughts of peace prevailed amongst them, and he said to the steward who was over his
house:  'Fill all their sacks with food, and return their money unto them into their vessels, and my
cup, the silver cup out of which I drink, put it in the sack of the youngest, and send them
away.'
