The Passover: regulations regarding its celebration. (Cf. Exod. xii.6, 9, 11, 13, 22-3,
30, 46; xv.22.)

<p>[Chapter 49]
<OL>
    <LI>Remember the commandment which the Lord commanded thee concerning the passover,
that thou shouldst celebrate it in its season on the fourteenth of the first month, that thou shouldst
kill it before it is evening, and that they should eat it by night on the evening of the fifteenth from
the 
    time of the setting of the sun.  <LI>For on this night -the beginning of the festival and the
beginning of the joy- ye were eating the passover in Egypt, when all the powers of Mast&ecirc;m&acirc; had
been let loose to slay all the first-born in the land of Egypt, from the first-born of Pharaoh to the
first-born
    of the captive maid-servant in the mill, and to the cattle.  <LI>And this is the sign which the
Lord gave them:  Into every house on the lintels of which they saw the blood of a lamb of the first
year, into (that) house they should not enter to slay, but should pass by (it), that all those should
be saved that
    were in the house because the sign of the blood was on its lintels.  <LI>And the powers of
the Lord did everything according as the Lord commanded them, and they passed by all the
children of Israel, and the plague came not upon them to destroy from amongst them any soul
either of cattle, or
    man, or dog.  <LI>And the plague was very grievous in Egypt, and there was no house in
Egypt
    where there was not one dead, and weeping and lamentation.  <LI>And all Israel was eating
the flesh of the paschal lamb, and drinking the wine, and was lauding, and blessing, and giving
thanks to the Lord God of their fathers, and was ready to go forth from under the yoke of Egypt,
and from
    the evil bondage.  <LI>And remember thou this day all the days of thy life, and observe it
from year to year all the days of thy life, once a year, on its day, according to all the law thereof,
and do not
    adjourn (it) from day to day, or from month to month.  <LI>For it is an eternal ordinance,
and engraven on the heavenly tablets regarding all the children of Israel that they should observe it
every year on its day once a year, throughout all their generations; and there is no limit of days,
for this is ordained
    for ever.  <LI>And the man who is free from uncleanness, and does not come to observe it on
occasion of its day, so as to bring an acceptable offering before the Lord, and to eat and to drink
before the Lord on the day of its festival, that man who is clean and close at hand shall be cut off: 
because he offered not the oblation of the Lord in its appointed season, he shall take the guilt
upon himself.
    <LI>Let the children of Israel come and observe the passover on the day of its fixed time,
on the fourteenth day of the first month, between the evenings, from the third part of the day to
the third part of
    the night, for two portions of the day are given to the light, and a third part to the
evening.  <LI>This
    is that which the Lord commanded thee that thou shouldst observe it between the
evenings.  <LI>And it is not permissible to slay it during any period of the light, but during the period
bordering on the evening, and let them eat it at the time of the evening, until the third part of the
night, and whatever is left over of all its flesh from the third part of the night and onwards, let
them burn
    it with fire.  <LI>And they shall not cook it with water, nor shall they eat it raw, but roast
on the fire:  they shall eat it with diligence, its head with the inwards thereof and its feet they shall
roast with fire, and not break any bone thereof; for of the children of Israel no bone shall be
crushed.
    <LI>For this reason the Lord commanded the children of Israel to observe the passover on
the day of its fixed time, and they shall not break a bone thereof; for it is a festival day, and a day
commanded, and there may be no passing over from day to day, and month to month, but on the
day of its
    festival let it be observed.  <LI>And do thou command the children of Israel to observe the
passover throughout their days, every year, once a year on the day of its fixed time, and it shall
come for a memorial well pleasing before the Lord, and no plague shall come upon them to slay
or to smite in that year in which they celebrate the passover in its season in every respect
according to His
    command.  <LI>And they shall not eat it outside the sanctuary of the Lord, but before the
sanctuary of the Lord, and all the people of the congregation of Israel shall celebrate it in its
appointed season.  
    <LI>And every man who has come upon its day shall eat it in the sanctuary of your God
before the Lord from twenty years old and upward; for thus is it written and ordained that they
should eat it
     in the sanctuary of the Lord.  <LI>And when the children of Israel come into the land which
they are to possess, into the land of Canaan, and set up the tabernacle of the Lord in the midst of
the land in one of their tribes until the sanctuary of the Lord has been built in the land, let them
come and celebrate the passover in the midst of the tabernacle of the Lord, and let them slay
it
    before the Lord from year to year.  <LI>And in the days when the house has been built in
the name of the Lord in the land of their inheritance, they shall go there and slay the passover in
the evening, at
    sunset, at the third part of the day.  <LI>And they shall offer its blood on the threshold of
the altar, and shall place its fat on the fire which is upon the altar, and they shall eat its flesh
roasted
    with fire in the court of the house which has been sanctified in the name of the Lord. 
<LI>And they may not celebrate the passover in their cities, nor in any place save before the tabernacle
of the Lord, or before His house where His name hath dwelt; and they shall not go astray from the
Lord.
    <LI>And do thou, Moses, command the children of Israel to observe the ordinances of the
passover, as it was commanded unto thee; declare thou unto them every year and the day of its
days, and the festival of unleavened bread, that they should eat unleavened bread seven days,
(and) that they should observe its festival, and that they bring an oblation every day during those
seven days of
    joy before the Lord on the altar of your God.  <LI>For ye celebrated this festival with haste
when ye went forth from Egypt till ye entered into the wilderness of Shur; for on the shore of the
sea ye completed it.
