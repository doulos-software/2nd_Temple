<p>[Chapter 18]
<OL>
     <LI>And God said to him, 'Abraham, Abraham'; and he said, Behold, (here) am I.'  <LI>And he
said, Take thy beloved son whom thou lovest, (even) Isaac, and go unto the high country, and
offer him
    on one of the mountains which I will point out unto thee.' <LI>And he rose early in the
morning and saddled his ass, and took his two young men with him, and Isaac his son, and clave
the wood of the
    burnt offering, and he went to the place on the third day, and he saw the place afar off. 
<LI>And he came to a well of water, and he said to his young men, 'Abide ye here with the ass, and I
and the
    lad shall go (yonder), and when we have worshipped we shall come again to you.'  <LI>And
he took the wood of the burnt-offering and laid it on Isaac his son, and he took in his hand the fire
and the
    knife, and they went both of them together to that place.  <LI>And Isaac said to his father,
'Father;' and he said, 'Here am I, my son.'  And he said unto him, 'Behold the fire, and the knife,
and the
    wood; but where is the sheep for the burnt-offering, father?' <LI>And he said, 'God will
provide for himself a sheep for a burnt-offering, my son.'  And he drew near to the place of the
mount of 
    God.  <LI>And he built an altar, and he placed the wood on the altar, and bound Isaac his
son, and placed him on the wood which was upon the altar, and stretched forth his hand to take
the knife
    to slay Isaac his son.  <LI>And I stood before him, and before the prince Mast&ecirc;m&acirc;, and the
Lord said, 'Bid him not to lay his hand on the lad, nor to do anything to him, for I have shown that
he fears 
    the Lord.'  <LI>And I called to him from heaven, and said unto him:  'Abraham, Abraham;'
and he 
    was terrified and said:  'Behold, (here) am I.'  <LI>And I said unto him:  'Lay not thy hand
upon the lad, neither do thou anything to him; for now I have shown that thou fearest the Lord,
and hast
    not withheld thy son, thy first-born son, from me.'  <LI>And the prince Mast&ecirc;m&acirc; was put to
shame; and Abraham lifted up his eyes and looked, and, behold a ram caught . . . by his horns, and
Abraham
    went and took the ram and offered it for a burnt-offering in the stead of his son.  <LI>And
Abraham called that place 'The Lord hath seen', so that it is said <em>in the mount</em> the Lord hath
seen:  that is 
    Mount Sion.  <LI>And the Lord called Abraham by his name a second time from heaven, as
he caused 
    us to appear to speak to him in the name of the Lord.  <LI>And he said:  'By Myself have I
sworn, saith the Lord,<P>

     Because thou hast done this thing, <BR>
     And hast not withheld thy son, thy beloved son, from Me,<BR>
     That in blessing I will bless thee,<P>

     And in multiplying I will multiply thy seed <BR>
     As the stars of heaven, And as the sand which is on the seashore.<P>

     And thy seed shall inherit the cities of its enemies,<BR>
   <LI>And in thy seed shall all nations of the earth be blessed;<P>

     Because thou hast obeyed My voice, <BR>
     And I have shown to all that thou art faithful unto Me in all that I have said unto thee: <P>

     Go in peace.'<P>

    <LI>And Abraham went to his young men, and they arose and went together to Beersheba,
and Abraham [2010 A.M.]
    dwelt by the Well of the Oath.  <LI>And he celebrated this festival every year, seven days
with joy, and he called it the festival of the Lord according to the seven days during which he
went and 
    returned in peace.  <LI>And accordingly has it been ordained and written on the heavenly
tablets regarding Israel and its seed that they should observe this festival seven days with the joy
of festival.
