<p>[Chapter 40]
<OL>
    <LI>And in those days Pharaoh dreamed two dreams in one night concerning a famine which
was to be in all the land, and he awoke from his sleep and called all the interpreters of dreams that
were in Egypt, and magicians, and told them his two dreams, and they were not able to declare
(them).
    <LI>And then the chief butler remembered Joseph and spake of him to the king, and he
brought him
    forth from the prison, and he to]d his two dreams before him.  <LI>And he said before
Pharaoh that his two dreams were one, and he said unto him:  'Seven years shall come (in which
there shall be) plenty over all the land of Egypt, and after that seven years of famine, such a
famine as has not been in all
    the land.  <LI>And now let Pharaoh appoint overseers in all the land of Egypt, and let them
store up food in every city throughout the days of the years of plenty, and there will be food for
the seven
    years of famine, and the land will not perish through the famine, for it will be very
severe.'  <LI>And the Lord gave Joseph favour and mercy in the eyes of Pharaoh, and Pharaoh said
unto his servants.  We shall not find such a wise and discreet man as this man, for the spirit of the
Lord is with 
    him.'  <LI>And he appointed him the second in all his kingdom and gave him authority over
all
    Egypt, and caused him to ride in the second chariot of Pharaoh.  <LI>And he clothed him
with byssus garments, and he put a gold chain upon his neck, and (a herald) proclaimed before
him ' 'El 'El wa 'Abirer,' and placed a ring on his hand and made him ruler over all his house, and
magnified him, and
    said unto him.  'Only on the throne shall I be greater than thou.'  <LI>And Joseph ruled over
all the land of Egypt, and all the princes of Pharaoh, and all his servants, and all who did the king's
business loved him, for he walked in uprightness, for he was without pride and arrogance, and he
had no respect of persons, and did not accept gifts, but he judged in uprightness all the people of
the land.
    <LI>And the land of Egypt was at peace before Pharaoh because of Joseph, for the Lord was
with him, and gave him favour and mercy for all his generations before all those who knew him
and those who heard concerning him, and Pharaoh's kingdom was well ordered, and there was no
Satan and no evil
    person (therein).  <LI>And the king called Joseph's name Sephantiphans, and gave Joseph to
wife the
    daughter of Potiphar, the daughter of the priest of Heliopolis, the chief cook.  <LI>And on
the day that
    Joseph stood before Pharaoh he was thirty years old [when he stood before Pharaoh]. 
<LI>And in that year Isaac died.  And it came to pass as Joseph had said in the interpretation of his
two dreams, according as he had said it, there were seven years of plenty over all the land of
Egypt, and the
    land of Egypt abundantly produced, one measure (producing) eighteen hundred
measures.  <LI>And Joseph gathered food into every city until they were full of corn until they could
no longer count and measure it for its multitude.
