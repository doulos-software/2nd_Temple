<p>[Chapter 14]
<OL>
    <LI>After these things, in the fourth year of this week, on the new moon of the third month,
the word of the Lord came to Abram in a dream, saying:  'Fear not, Abram; I am thy defender,
and
    thy reward will be exceeding great.'  <LI>And he said:  'Lord, Lord, what wilt thou give me,
seeing I go hence childless, and the son of Maseq, the son of my handmaid, is the Dammasek
Eliezer:  he
    will be my heir, and to me thou hast given no seed.'  <LI>And he said unto him:  'This (man)
will not
    be thy heir, but one that will come out of thine own bowels; he will be thine heir.' <LI>And
He brought him forth abroad, and said unto him:  'Look toward heaven and number the stars if
thou 
    art able to number them.'  <LI>And he looked toward heaven, and beheld the stars.  And He
said 
    unto him:  'So shall thy seed be.'  <LI>And he believed in the Lord, and it was counted to him
for 
    righteousness.  <LI>And He said unto him:  'I am the Lord that brought thee out of Ur of the
Chaldees, to give thee the land of the Canaanites to possess it for ever; and I will be God unto
thee and to 
    thy seed after thee.'  <LI>And he said:  'Lord, Lord, whereby shall I know that I shall inherit
(it)?' 
    <LI>And He said unto him:  'Take Me an heifer of three years, and a goat of three years, and
a sheep
    of three years, and a turtle-dove, and a pigeon.'  <LI>And he took all these in the middle of
the month
    and he dwelt at the oak of Mamre, which is near Hebron.  <LI>And he built there an altar,
and sacrificed all these; and he poured their blood upon the altar, and divided them in the midst,
and
    laid them over against each other; but the birds divided he not.  <LI>And birds came down
upon the 
    pieces, and Abram drove them away, and did not suffer the birds to touch them.  <LI>And it
came to pass, when the sun had set, that an ecstasy fell upon Abram, and lo ! an horror of great
darkness fell upon him, and it was said unto Abram:  'Know of a surety that thy seed shall be a
stranger in a land (that is) not theirs, and they shall bring them into bondage, and afflict them four
hundred
    years.  <LI>And the nation also to whom they will be in bondage will I judge, and after that
they shall
    come forth thence with much substance.  <LI>And thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace, and
be buried
    in a good old age.  <LI>But in the fourth generation they shall return hither; for the iniquity
of the
    Amorites is not yet full.'  <LI>And he awoke from his sleep, and he arose, and the sun had
set; and there was a flame, and behold ! a furnace was smoking, and a flame of fire passed
between the
     pieces.  <LI>And on that day the Lord made a covenant with Abram, saying:  'To thy seed
will I give this land, from the river of Egypt unto the great river, the river Euphrates, the Kenites,
the Kenizzites, the Kadmonites, the Perizzites, and the Rephaim, the Phakorites, and the Hivites,
and the
    Amorites, and the Canaanites, and the Girgashites, and the Jebusites.  <LI>And the day
passed, and Abram offered the pieces, and the birds, and their fruit offerings, and their drink
offerings, and
    the fire devoured them.  <LI>And on that day we made a covenant with Abram, according
as we had covenanted with Noah in this month; and Abram renewed the festival and ordinance for
himself
    for ever.  <LI>And Abram rejoiced, and made all these things known to Sarai his wife; and
he believed
    that he would have seed, but she did not bear.  <LI>And Sarai advised her husband Abram,
and said unto him:  'Go in unto Hagar, my Egyptian maid:  it may be that I shall build up seed
unto thee
    by her.'  <LI>And Abram harkened unto the voice of Sarai his wife, and said unto her, 'Do
(so).' And Sarai took Hagar, her maid, the Egyptian, and gave her to Abram, her husband, to be
his
    wife.  <LI>And he went in unto her, and she conceived and bare him a son, and he called his
name Ishmael, in the fifth year of this week [1965 A.M.]; and this was the eighty-sixth year in the
life of Abram.
