<blockquote>The Letter of Peter which he sent to Philip</blockquote>

<blockquote>&quot;Peter, the apostle of Jesus Christ, to Philip, our beloved
brother and our fellow apostle, and (to) the brethren who are with you:
greetings!</blockquote>

<blockquote>Now I want you to know, our brother, that we received orders
from our Lord and the Savior of the whole world that we should come together
to give instruction and preach in the salvation which was promised us by
our Lord Jesus Christ. But as for you, you were separate from us, and you
did not desire us to come together and to know how we should organize ourselves
in order that we might tell the good news. Therefore would it be agreeable
to you, our brother, to come according to the orders of our God Jesus?&quot;</blockquote>

<blockquote>When Philip had received these (words), and when he had read
them, he went to Peter rejoicing with gladness. Then Peter gathered the
others also. They went upon the mountain which is called &quot;the (mount) olives,&quot;
the place where they used to gather with the blessed Christ when he was
in the body.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Then, when the apostles had come together, and had thrown themselves
upon their knees, they prayed thus saying, &quot;Father, Father, Father of the
light, who possesses the incorruptions, hear us just as thou hast taken
pleasure in thy holy child Jesus Christ. For he became for us an illuminator
in the darkness. Yea hear us!&quot;</blockquote>

<blockquote>And they prayed again another time, saying, &quot;Son of life, Son
of immortality, who is in the light, Son, Christ of immortality, our Redeemer,
give us power, for they seek to kill us!&quot;</blockquote>

<blockquote>Then a great light appeared so that the mountains shone from
the sight of him who had appeared. And a voice called out to them saying,
&quot;Listen to my words that I may speak to you. Why are you asking me? I am
Jesus Christ who am with you forever.&quot;</blockquote>

<blockquote>Then the apostles answered and said, &quot;Lord, we would like to
know the deficiency of the aeons and their pleroma.&quot; And: &quot;How are we detained
in this dwelling place?&quot; Further: &quot;How did we come to this place?&quot; And:
&quot;In what manner shall we depart?&quot; Again: &quot;How do we have the authority
of boldness?&quot; And: &quot;Why do the powers fight against us?&quot;</blockquote>

<blockquote>Then a voice came to them out of the light saying, &quot;It is you
yourselves who are witnesses that I spoke all these things to you. But
because of your unbelief I shall speak again. First of all concerning the
deficiency of the aeons, this is the deficiency, when the disobedience
and the foolishness of the mother appeared without the commandment of the
majesty of the Father. She wanted to raise up aeons. And when she spoke,
the Arrogant One followed. And when she left behind a part, the Arrogant
One laid hold of it, and it became a deficiency. This is the deficiency
of the aeons. Now when the Arrogant One had taken a part, he sowed it.
And he placed powers over it and authorities. And he enclosed it in the
aeons which are dead. And all the powers of the world rejoiced that they
had been begotten. But they do not know the pre-existent Father, since
they are strangers to him. But this is the one to whom they gave power
and whom they served by praising him. But he, the Arrogant One, became
proud on account of the praise of the powers. He became an envier and he
wanted to make an image in the place of an image, and a form in the place
of a form. And he commissioned the powers within his authority to mold
mortal bodies. And they came to be from a misrepresentation, from the semblance
which had merged.&quot;</blockquote>

<blockquote>&quot;Next concerning the pleroma: I am the one who was sent down
in the body because of the seed which had fallen away. And I came down
into their mortal mold. But they did not recognize me; they were thinking
of me that I was a mortal man. And I spoke with him who belongs to me,
and he harkened to me just as you too who harkened today. And I gave him
authority in order that he might enter into the inheritance of his fatherhood.
And I took [...] they were filled [...] in his salvation. And since he
was a deficiency, for this reason he became a pleroma.&quot;</blockquote>

<blockquote>&quot;It is because of this that you are being detained, because
you belong to me. When you strip off from yourselves what is corrupted,
then you will become illuminators in the midst of mortal men.&quot;</blockquote>

<blockquote>&quot;And this (is the reason) that you will fight against the powers,
because they do not have rest like you, since they do not wish that you
be saved.&quot;</blockquote>

<blockquote>Then the apostles worshiped again saying, &quot;Lord, tell us: In
what way shall we fight against the archons, since the archons are above
us?&quot;</blockquote>

<blockquote>Then a voice called out to them from the appearance saying,
&quot;Now you will fight against them in this way, for the archons are fighting
against the inner man. And you are to fight against them in this way: Come
together and teach in the world the salvation with a promise. And you,
gird yourselves with the power of my Father, and let your prayer be known.
And he, the Father, will help you as he has helped you by sending me. Be
not afraid, I am with you forever, as I previously said to you when I was
in the body.&quot; Then there came lightning and thunder from heaven, and what
appeared to them in that place was taken up to heaven.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Then the apostles gave thanks to the Lord with every blessing.
And they returned to Jerusalem. And while coming up they spoke with each
other on the road concerning the light which had come. And a remark was
made concerning the Lord. It was said, &quot;If he, our Lord, suffered, then
how much (must) we (suffer)?&quot;</blockquote>

<blockquote>Peter answered saying, &quot;He suffered on our behalf, and it is
necessary for us too to suffer because of our smallness.&quot; Then a voice
came to them saying, &quot;I have told you many times: it is necessary for you
to suffer. It is necessary that they bring you to synagogues and governors,
so that you will suffer. But he who does not suffer and does not [...]
the Father [...] in order that he may [...].&quot;</blockquote>

<blockquote>And the apostles rejoiced greatly and came up to Jerusalem.
And they came up to the temple and gave instruction in salvation in the
name of the Lord Jesus Christ. And they healed a multitude.</blockquote>

<blockquote>And Peter opened his mouth, he said to his (fellow) disciples,
&quot;Did our Lord Jesus, when he was in the body, show us everything? For he
came down. My brothers, listen to my voice.&quot; And he was filled with a holy
spirit. He spoke thus: &quot;Our illuminator, Jesus, came down and was crucified.
And he bore a crown of thorns. And he put on a purple garment. And he was
crucified on a tree and he was buried in a tomb. And he rose from the dead.
My brothers, Jesus is a stranger to this suffering. But we are the ones
who have suffered through the transgression of the mother. And because
of this, he did everything like us. For the Lord Jesus, the Son of the
immeasurable glory of the Father, he is the author of our life. My brothers,
let us therefore not obey these lawless ones, and walk in [...].&quot;</blockquote>

<blockquote>[...] Then Peter gathered together the others also, saying,
&quot;O, Lord Jesus Christ, author of our rest, give us a spirit of understanding
in order that we also may perform wonders.&quot;</blockquote>

<blockquote>Then Peter and the other apostles saw him, and they were filled
with a holy spirit, And each one performed healings. And they parted in
order to preach the Lord Jesus. And they came together and greeted each
other saying, &quot;Amen.&quot;</blockquote>

<blockquote>Then Jesus appeared saying to them, &quot;Peace to you all and everyone
who believes in my name. And when you depart, joy be to you and grace and
power. And be not afraid; behold, I am with you forever.&quot;</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<center>Then the apostles parted from each other into four words in order
to preach. And they went by a power of Jesus, in peace.&nbsp;
