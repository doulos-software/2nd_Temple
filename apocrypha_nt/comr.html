<p>Originally known as The Manual of Discipline, the Community Rule contains
a set of regulations ordering the life of the members of the &quot;yahad,&quot; the
group within the Judean Desert sect who chose to live communally and whose
members accepted strict rules of conduct. This fragment cites the admonitions
and punishments to be imposed on violators of the rules, the method of
joining the group, the relations between the members, their way of life,
and their beliefs. The sect divided humanity between the righteous and
the wicked and asserted that human nature and everything that happens in
the world are irrevocably predestined. The scroll ends with songs of praise
to God.
<p>A complete copy of the scroll, eleven columns in length, was found in
Cave 1. Ten fragmentary copies were recovered in Cave 4, and a small section
was found in Cave 5. The large number of manuscript copies attests to the
importance of this text for the sect. This particular fragment is the longest
of the versions of this text found in Cave 4.

<p>English Translation of The Community Rule
<p>And according to his insight he shall admit him. In this way both his
love and his hatred. No man shall argue or quarrel with the men of perdition.
He shall keep his council in secrecy in the midst of the men of deceit
and admonish with knowledge, truth and righteous commandment those of chosen
conduct, each according to his spiritual quality and according to the norm
of time. He shall guide them with knowledge and instruct them in the mysteries
of wonder and truth in the midst of the members of the community, so that
they shall behave decently with one another in all that has been revealed
to them. That is the time for studying the Torah (lit. clearing the way)
in the wilderness. He shall instruct them to do all that is required at
that time, and to separate from all those who have not turned aside from
all deceit. These are the norms of conduct for the Master in those times
with respect to his loving and to his everlasting hating of the men of
perdition in a spirit of secrecy. He shall leave to them property and wealth
and earnings like a slave to his lord, (showing) humility before the one
who rules over him. He shall be zealous concerning the Law and be prepared
for the Day of Revenge. He shall perform the will [of God] in all his deeds
and in all strength as He has commanded. He shall freely delight in all
that befalls him, and shall desire nothing except God's will...
