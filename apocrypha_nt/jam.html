<center>Translated by Francis E. Williams</center>

<hr>
<blockquote>James writes to [...]: Peace be with you from Peace, love from
Love, grace from Grace, faith from Faith, life from Holy Life!</blockquote>

<blockquote>Since you asked that I send you a secret book which was revealed
to me and Peter by the Lord, I could not turn you away or gainsay (?) you;
but I have written it in the Hebrew alphabet and sent it to you, and you
alone. But since you are a minister of the salvation of the saints, endeavor
earnestly and take care not to rehearse this text to many - this that the
Savior did not wish to tell to all of us, his twelve disciples. But blessed
will they be who will be saved through the faith of this discourse.</blockquote>

<blockquote>I also sent you, ten months ago, another secret book which
the Savior had revealed to me. Under the circumstances, however, regard
that one as revealed to me, James; but this one ... [untranslatable fragments]</blockquote>

<blockquote>... the twelve disciples were all sitting together and recalling
what the Savior had said to each one of them, whether in secret or openly,
and putting it in books - But I was writing that which was in my book -
lo, the Savior appeared, after departing from us while we gazed after him.
And five hundred and fifty days since he had risen from the dead, we said
to him, &quot;Have you departed and removed yourself from us?&quot; But Jesus said,
&quot;No, but I shall go to the place from whence I came. If you wish to come
with me, come!&quot;</blockquote>

<blockquote>They all answered and said, &quot;If you bid us, we come.&quot;
<br>He said, &quot;Verily I say unto you, no one will ever enter the kingdom
of heaven at my bidding, but (only) because you yourselves are full. Leave
James and Peter to me, that I may fill them.&quot; And having called these two,
he drew them aside and bade the rest occupy themselves with that which
they were about.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The Savior said, &quot;You have received mercy ...
<br>(7 lines missing)
<br>Do you not, then, desire to be filled? And your heart is drunken; do
you not, then, desire to be sober? Therefore, be ashamed! Henceforth, waking
or sleeping, remember that you have seen the Son of Man, and spoken with
him in person, and listened to him in person. Woe to those who have seen
the Son of Man; blessed will they be who have not seen the man, and they
who have not consorted with him, and they who have not spoken with him,
and they who have not listened to anything from him; yours is life! Know,
then, that he healed you when you were ill, that you might reign. Woe to
those who have found relief from their illness, for they will relapse into
illness. Blessed are they who have not been ill, and have known relief
before falling ill; yours is the kingdom of God. Therefore, I say to you,
'Become full, and leave no space within you empty, for he who is coming
can mock you.&quot;</blockquote>

<blockquote>Then Peter replied, &quot;Lo, three times you have told us, 'Become
full'; but we are full.&quot;
<br>The Savior answered and said, &quot;For this cause I have said to you, 'Become
full,' that you may not be in want. They who are in want, however, will
not be saved. For it is good to be full, and bad to be in want. Hence,
just as it is good that you be in want and, conversely, bad that you be
full, so he who is full is in want, and he who is in want does not become
full as he who is in want becomes full, and he who has been filled, in
turn attains due perfection. Therefore, you must be in want while it is
possible to fill you, and be full while it is possible for you to be in
want, so that you may be able to fill yourselves the more. Hence, become
full of the Spirit, but be in want of reason, for reason &lt;belongs to&gt;
the soul; in turn, it is (of the nature of) soul.&quot;</blockquote>

<blockquote>But I answered and said to him, &quot;Lord, we can obey you if you
wish, for we have forsaken our fathers and our mothers and our villages,
and followed you. Grant us, therefore, not to be tempted by the devil,
the evil one.&quot;
<br>The Lord answered and said, &quot;What is your merit if you do the will
of the Father and it is not given to you from him as a gift while you are
tempted by Satan? But if you are oppressed by Satan, and persecuted, and
you do his (i.e., the Father's) will, I say that he will love you, and
make you equal with me, and reckon you to have become beloved through his
providence by your own choice. So will you not cease loving the flesh and
being afraid of sufferings? Or do you not know that you have yet to be
abused and to be accused unjustly; and have yet to be shut up in prison,
and condemned unlawfully, and crucified &lt;without&gt; reason, and buried
as I myself, by the evil one? Do you dare to spare the flesh, you for whom
the Spirit is an encircling wall? If you consider how long the world existed
&lt;before&gt; you, and how long it will exist after you, you will find that
your life is one single day, and your sufferings one single hour. For the
good will not enter into the world. Scorn death, therefore, and take thought
for life! Remember my cross and my death, and you will live!&quot;</blockquote>

<blockquote>But I answered and said to him, &quot;Lord, do not mention to us
the cross and death, for they are far from you.&quot;
<br>The Lord answered and said, &quot;Verily, I say unto you, none will be saved
unless they believe in my cross. But those who have believed in my cross,
theirs is the kingdom of God. Therefore, become seekers for death, like
the dead who seek for life; for that which they seek is revealed to them.
And what is there to trouble them? As for you, when you examine death,
it will teach you election. Verily, I say unto you, none of those who fear
death will be saved; for the kingdom belongs to those who put themselves
to death. Become better than I; make yourselves like the son of the Holy
Spirit!&quot;</blockquote>

<blockquote>Then I asked him, &quot;Lord, how shall we be able to prophesy to
those who request us to prophesy to them? For there are many who ask us,
and look to us to hear an oracle from us.&quot;
<br>The Lord answered and said, &quot;Do you not know that the head of prophecy
was cut off with John?&quot;
<br>But I said, &quot;Lord, can it be possible to remove the head of prophecy?&quot;
<br>The Lord said to me, &quot;When you come to know what 'head' means, and
that prophecy issues from the head, (then) understand the meaning of 'Its
head was removed.' At first I spoke to you in parables, and you did not
understand; now I speak to you openly, and you (still) do not perceive.
Yet, it was you who served me as a parable in parables, and as that which
is open in the (words) that are open.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&quot;Hasten to be saved without being urged! Instead, be eager
of your own accord, and, if possible, arrive even before me; for thus the
Father will love you.&quot;</blockquote>

<blockquote>&quot;Come to hate hypocrisy and the evil thought; for it is the
thought that gives birth to hypocrisy; but hypocrisy is far from truth.&quot;</blockquote>

<blockquote>&quot;Do not allow the kingdom of heaven to wither; for it is like
a palm shoot whose fruit has dropped down around it. They (i.e., the fallen
fruit) put forth leaves, and after they had sprouted, they caused their
womb to dry up. So it is also with the fruit which had grown from this
single root; when it had been picked (?), fruit was borne by many (?).
It (the root) was certainly good, (and) if it were possible for you to
produce the new plants now, &lt;you&gt; would find it.&quot;</blockquote>

<blockquote>&quot;Since I have already been glorified in this fashion, why do
you hold me back in my eagerness to go? For after the labor, you have compelled
me to stay with you another eighteen days for the sake of the parables.
It was enough for some &lt;to listen&gt; to the teaching and understand 'The
Shepherds' and 'The Seed' and 'The Building' and 'The Lamps of the Virgins'
and 'The Wage of the Workmen' and the 'Didrachmae' and 'The Woman.'&quot;</blockquote>

<blockquote>&quot;Become earnest about the word! For as to the word, its first
part is faith; the second, love; the third, works; for from these comes
life. For the word is like a grain of wheat; when someone had sown it,
he had faith in it; and when it had sprouted, he loved it, because he had
seen many grains in place of one. And when he had worked, he was saved,
because he had prepared it for food, (and) again he left (some) to sow.
So also can you yourselves receive the kingdom of heaven; unless you receive
this through knowledge, you will not be able to find it.&quot;</blockquote>

<blockquote>&quot;Therefore, I say to you, be sober; do not be deceived! And
many times have I said to you all together, and also to you alone, James,
have I said, 'Be saved!' And I have commanded you to follow me, and I have
taught you what to say before the archons. Observe that I have descended
and have spoken and undergone tribulation, and carried off my crown after
saving you. For I came down to dwell with you, so that you in turn might
dwell with me. And, finding your houses unceiled, I have made my abode
in the houses that could receive me at the time of my descent.&quot;</blockquote>

<blockquote>&quot;Therefore, trust in me, my brethren; understand what the great
light is. The Father has no need of me, - for a father does not need a
son, but it is the son who needs the father - though I go to him. For the
Father of the Son has no need of you.&quot;</blockquote>

<blockquote>&quot;Hearken to the word, understand knowledge, love life, and
no one will persecute you, nor will anyone oppress you, other than you
yourselves.&quot;</blockquote>

<blockquote>&quot;O you wretches; O you unfortunates; O you pretenders to the
truth; O you falsifiers of knowledge; O you sinners against the Spirit:
can you still bear to listen, when it behooved you to speak from the first?
Can you still bear to sleep, when it behooved you to be awake from the
first, so that the kingdom of heaven might receive you? Verily, I say unto
you, had I been sent to those who listen to me, and had I spoken with them,
I would never have come down to earth. So, then, be ashamed for these things.&quot;</blockquote>

<blockquote>&quot;Behold, I shall depart from you and go away, and do not wish
to remain with you any longer, just as your yourselves have not wished
it. Now, therefore, follow me quickly. This is why I say unto you, 'For
your sakes I came down.' You are the beloved; you are they who will be
the cause of life in many. Invoke the Father, implore God often, and he
will give to you. Blessed is he who has seen you with Him when He was proclaimed
among the angels, and glorified among the saints; yours is life. Rejoice,
and be glad, as sons of God. Keep his will, that you may be saved; accept
reproof from me and save yourselves. I intercede on your behalf with the
Father, and he will forgive you much.&quot;</blockquote>

<blockquote>And when we had heard these words, we became glad, for we had
been grieved at the words we have mentioned before. But when he saw us
rejoicing, he said, &quot;Woe to you who lack an advocate! Woe to you who stand
in need of grace! Blessed will they be who have spoken out and obtained
grace for themselves. Liken yourselves to foreigners; of what sort are
they in the eyes of your city? Why are you disturbed when you cast yourselves
away of your own accord and separate yourselves from your city? Why do
you abandon your dwelling place of your own accord, making it ready for
those who want to dwell in it? O you outcasts and fugitives, woe to you,
for you will be caught! Or do you perhaps think that the Father is a lover
of mankind, or that he is won over without prayers, or that he grants remission
to one on another's behalf, or that he bears with one who asks? - For he
knows the desire, and also what it is that the flesh needs! - (Or do you
think) that it is not this (flesh) that desires the soul? For without the
soul, the body does not sin, just as the soul is not saved without the
spirit. But if the soul is saved (when it is) without evil, and the spirit
is also saved, then the body becomes free from sin. For it is the spirit
that raises the soul, but the body that kills it; that is, it is it (the
soul) which kills itself. Verily, I say unto you, he will not forgive the
soul the sin by any means, nor the flesh the guilt; for none of those who
have worn the flesh will be saved. For do you think that many have found
the kingdom of heaven? Blessed is he who has seen himself as a fourth one
in heaven!&quot;</blockquote>

<blockquote>When we heard these words, we were distressed. But when he
saw that we were distressed, he said, &quot;For this cause I tell you this,
that you may know yourselves. For the kingdom of heaven is like an ear
of grain after it had sprouted in a field. And when it had ripened, it
scattered its fruit and again filled the field with ears for another year.
You also, hasten to reap an ear of life for yourselves, that you may be
filled with the kingdom!&quot;</blockquote>

<blockquote>&quot;And as long as I am with you, give heed to me, and obey me;
but when I depart from you, remember me. And remember me because when I
was with you, you did not know me. Blessed will they be who have known
me; woe to those who have heard and have not believed! Blessed will they
be who have not see, yet have believed!&quot;</blockquote>

<blockquote>&quot;And once more I prevail upon you, for I am revealed to you
building a house which is of great value to you when you find shelter beneath
it, just as it will be able to stand by your neighbors' house when it threatens
to fall. Verily, I say unto you, woe to those for whose sakes I was sent
down to this place; blessed will they be who ascend to the Father! Once
more I reprove you, you who are; become like those who are not, that you
may be with those who are not.&quot;</blockquote>

<blockquote>&quot;Do not make the kingdom of heaven a desert within you. Do
not be proud because of the light that illumines, but be to yourselves
as I myself am to you. For your sakes I have placed myself under the curse,
that you may be saved.&quot;</blockquote>

<blockquote>But Peter replied to these words and said, &quot;Sometimes you urge
us on to the kingdom of heaven, and then again you turn us back, Lord;
sometimes you persuade and draw us to faith and promise us life, and then
again you cast us forth from the kingdom of heaven.&quot;</blockquote>

<blockquote>But the Lord answered and said to us, &quot;I have given you faith
many times; moreover, I have revealed myself to you, James, and you (all)
have not known me. Now again, I see you rejoicing many times; and when
you are elated at the promise of life, are you yet sad, and do you grieve,
when you are instructed in the kingdom? But you, through faith and knowledge,
have received life. Therefore, disdain the rejection when you hear it,
but when you hear the promise, rejoice the more. Verily, I say unto you,
he who will receive life and believe in the kingdom will never leave it,
not even if the Father wishes to banish him.&quot;</blockquote>

<blockquote>&quot;These are the things that I shall tell you so far; now, however,
I shall ascend to the place from whence I came. But you, when I was eager
to go, have cast me out, and instead of accompanying me, you have pursued
me. But pay heed to the glory that awaits me, and, having opened your heart,
listen to the hymns that await me up in the heavens; for today I must take
(my place at) the right hand of the Father. But I have said (my) last word
to you, and I shall depart from you, for a chariot of spirit has borne
me aloft, and from this moment on, I shall strip myself, that I may clothe
myself.
But give heed; blessed are they who have proclaimed the Son before his
descent, that when I have come, I might ascend (again). Thrice blessed
are they who were proclaimed by the Son before they came to be, that you
might have a portion among them.&quot;</blockquote>

<blockquote>Having said these words, he departed. But we bent (our) knee(s),
I and Peter, and gave thanks, and sent our heart(s) upwards to heaven.
We heard with our ears, and saw with our eyes, the noise of wars, and a
trumpet blare, and a great turmoil.</blockquote>

<blockquote>And when we had passed beyond that place, we sent our mind(s)
farther upwards, and saw with our eyes and heard with our ears hymns, and
angelic benedictions, and angelic rejoicing. And heavenly majesties were
singing praise, and we, too, rejoiced.</blockquote>

<blockquote>After this again, we wished to send our spirit upward to the
Majesty, and after ascending, we were not permitted to see or hear anything,
for the other disciples called us and asked us, &quot;What did you hear from
the Master. And what has he said to you? And where did he go?&quot;</blockquote>

<blockquote>But we answered them, &quot;He has ascended, and has given us a
pledge, and promised life to us all, and revealed to us children (?) who
are to come after us, after bidding us love them, as we would be saved
for their sakes.&quot;</blockquote>

<blockquote>And when they heard (this), they indeed believed the revelation,
but were displeased about those to be born. And so, not wishing to give
them offense, I sent each one to another place. But I myself went up to
Jerusalem, praying that I might obtain a portion among the beloved, who
will be made manifest.</blockquote>

<blockquote>And I pray that the beginning may come from you, for thus I
shall be capable of salvation, since they will be enlightened through me,
by my faith - and through another (faith) that is better than mine, for
I would that mine be the lesser. Endeavor earnestly, then, to make yourself
like them, and pray that you may obtain a portion with them. For because
of what I have said, the Savior did not make the revelation to us for their
sakes. We do, indeed, proclaim a portion with those for whom the proclamation
was made - those whom the Lord has made his sons.&nbsp;
