 <HR>
 <B>Introduction</B>
 
 <BR>This document is an <A Href="http://ancientneareast.tripod.com/Ugarit_Shamra.html">Ugaritic</A> 
 text from <A Href="http://www.ed.ac.uk/~ugarit/home.htm">Ras Shamra</A>, and may be as old as Abraham.  
 It describes the goings-on among the Canaanites on the coast to the north of Gerar.
 It is both a ritual and a historical document.

 <P>
 <B>Summary</B>
 The subject of the first tablet is the rehabilitation of the royal house after disaster, 
 with the wooing of Krt.  The second tablet describes the royal wedding.  The third speaks
 to the illness and threatened eclips of Krt (the ritual king), when his oldest son Ysb 
 takes advantage to seek to supplant him.

 <P>The drama has a definite moral and social object.  According to John Gray, &quot;such
 as the securing of a legitimate queen and the establishment of the royal line.&quot;

 <P>In the Krt story the powers of the old king are failing, and he is told by his youthful
 would-be successor: &quot;In the sepulchral cave thou wild abide... Sickness is as (thy)
 bedfellow, Disease (thy) concubine.&quot;

 <P>It has been proposed that this Krt may have been one (of the two) stories of the abduction
 of Sarah (the wife of Abraham) by the king of a foriegn land (in this case, King Krt); the
 story being from King Krt's point of view.[&quot;Abraham In Egypt&quot;, Nibley <I>F.A.R.M.S.</I>, p.354]

The clan [of Kret] died out;<BR>
the house of the [k]ing was destroyed,<BR>

Kret, his children wiped out,<BR>
Kret is devoid of an estate.<BR>
He had taken his wife,<BR>
his destined bride.<BR>
He took a wife, but she departed.<BR>
Progeny by a mother had been his:

Kret sees his progeny,<BR>

And in its totality a family has died off,<BR>

He enters his room, he weeps.<BR>
While uttering [w]ords, he sheds tears.<BR>
His tears are poured like sheqels on the ground,<BR>
like 1/5-sheqels on the bed.<BR>
As he cries, he falls asleep;<BR>

Sleep overcomes him;<BR>
he lies in sleep<BR>

And in his dream, El descends,<BR>
in his vision, the Father of Humanity.<BR>
And he draws close, asking Kret,<BR>
"Who is Kret that he should cry<BR>
the Good One, the Lad of El,<BR>
that he should shed tears?<BR>
Does he desire the monarchy of the [B]ull, his father,<BR>
or sovereign[ty] like the Father of Humanity?"<BR><BR>
