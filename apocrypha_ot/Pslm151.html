<h3>
Ps151.1</h3>
[<b>2</b>] My hands made a harp, my fingers fashioned a lyre.
<br>[<b>3</b>] And who will declare it to my Lord? The Lord himself; it
is he who hears.
<br>[<b>4</b>] It was he who sent his messenger and took me from my father's
sheep, and anointed me with his anointing oil.
<br>[<b>5</b>] My brothers were handsome and tall, but the Lord was not
pleased with them.
<br>[<b>6</b>] I went out to meet the Philistine, and he cursed me by his
idols.
<br>[<b>7</b>] But I drew his own sword; I beheaded him, and removed reproach
from the people of Israel.
