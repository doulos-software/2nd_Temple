<h3>
Sir.0</h3>
[<b>1-14</b>] Whereas many great teachings have been given to us through
the law and the prophets and the others that followed them, on account
of which we should praise Israel for instruction and wisdom; and since
it is necessary not only that the readers themselves should acquire understanding
but also that those who love learning should be able to help the outsiders
by both speaking and writing, my grandfather Jesus, after devoting himself
especially to the reading of the law and the prophets and the other books
of our fathers, and after acquiring considerable proficiency in them, was
himself also led to write something pertaining to instruction and wisdom,
in order that, by becoming conversant with this also, those who love learning
should make even greater progress in living according to the law.
<br>[<b>15-26</b>]
<p>You are urged therefore to read with good will and attention, and to
be indulgent in cases where, despite out diligent labor in translating,
we may seem to have rendered some phrases imperfectly. For what was originally
expressed in Hebrew does not have exactly the same sense when translated
into another language. Not only this work, but even the law itself, the
prophecies, and the rest of the books differ not a little as originally
expressed.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>[<b>27-36</b>]
<p>When I came to Egypt in the thirty-eighth year of the reign of Euergetes
and stayed for some time, I found opportunity for no little instruction.
It seemed highly necessary that I should myself devote some pains and labor
to the translation of the following book, using in that period of time
great watchfulness and skill in order to complete and publish the book
for those living abroad who wished to gain learning, being prepared in
character to live according to the law.

<h3>
Sir.1</h3>
[<b>1</b>] All wisdom comes from the Lord and is with him for ever.
<br>[<b>2</b>] The sand of the sea, the drops of rain, and the days of
eternity -- who can count them?
<br>[<b>3</b>] The height of heaven, the breadth of the earth, the abyss,
and wisdom -- who can search them out?
<br>[<b>4</b>] Wisdom was created before all things, and prudent understanding
from eternity.
<br>[<b>5</b>] The root of wisdom -- to whom has it been revealed? Her
clever devices -- who knows them?
<br>[<b>6</b>] There is One who is wise, greatly to be feared, sitting
upon his throne.
<br>[<b>7</b>] The Lord himself created wisdom; he saw her and apportioned
her, he poured her out upon all his works.
<br>[<b>8</b>] She dwells with all flesh according to his gift, and he
supplied her to those who love him.
<br>[<b>9</b>] The fear of the Lord is glory and exultation, and gladness
and a crown of rejoicing.
<br>[<b>10</b>] The fear of the Lord delights the heart, and gives gladness
and joy and long life.
<br>[<b>11</b>] With him who fears the Lord it will go well at the end;
on the day of his death he will be blessed.
<br>[<b>12</b>] To fear the Lord is the beginning of wisdom; she is created
with the faithful in the womb.
<br>[<b>13</b>] She made among men an eternal foundation, and among their
descendants she will be trusted.
<br>[<b>14</b>] To fear the Lord is wisdom's full measure; she satisfies
men with her fruits;
<br>[<b>15</b>] she fills their whole house with desirable goods, and their
storehouses with her produce.
<br>[<b>16</b>] The fear of the Lord is the crown of wisdom, making peace
and perfect health to flourish.
<br>[<b>17</b>] He saw her and apportioned her; he rained down knowledge
and discerning comprehension, and he exalted the glory of those who held
her fast.
<br>[<b>18</b>] To fear the Lord is the root of wisdom, and her branches
are long life.
<br>[<b>22</b>] Unrighteous anger cannot be justified, for a man's anger
tips the scale to his ruin.
<br>[<b>23</b>] A patient man will endure until the right moment, and then
joy will burst forth for him.
<br>[<b>24</b>] He will hide his words until the right moment, and the
lips of many will tell of his good sense.
<br>[<b>25</b>] In the treasuries of wisdom are wise sayings, but godliness
is an abomination to a sinner.
<br>[<b>26</b>] If you desire wisdom, keep the commandments, and the Lord
will supply it for you.
<br>[<b>27</b>] For the fear of the Lord is wisdom and instruction, and
he delights in fidelity and meekness.
<br>[<b>28</b>] Do not disobey the fear of the Lord; do not approach him
with a divided mind.
<br>[<b>29</b>] Be not a hypocrite in men's sight, and keep watch over
your lips.
<br>[<b>30</b>] Do not exalt yourself lest you fall, and thus bring dishonor
upon yourself. The Lord will reveal your secrets
<br>and cast you down in the midst of the congregation, because you did
not come in the fear of the Lord, and your heart was full of deceit.
<p>
<hr>
<h3>
Sir.2</h3>
[<b>1</b>] My son, if you come forward to serve the Lord, prepare yourself
for temptation.
<br>[<b>2</b>] Set your heart right and be steadfast, and do not be hasty
in time of calamity.
<br>[<b>3</b>] Cleave to him and do not depart, that you may be honored
at the end of your life.
<br>[<b>4</b>] Accept whatever is brought upon you, and in changes that
humble you be patient.
<br>[<b>5</b>] For gold is tested in the fire, and acceptable men in the
furnace of humiliation.
<br>[<b>6</b>] Trust in him, and he will help you; make your ways straight,
and hope in him.
<br>[<b>7</b>] You who fear the Lord, wait for his mercy; and turn not
aside, lest you fall.
<br>[<b>8</b>] You who fear the Lord, trust in him, and your reward will
not fail;
<br>[<b>9</b>] you who fear the Lord, hope for good things, for everlasting
joy and mercy.
<br>[<b>10</b>] Consider the ancient generations and see: who ever trusted
in the Lord and was put to shame? Or who ever persevered in the fear of
the Lord and was forsaken? Or who ever called upon him and was overlooked?
<br>[<b>11</b>] For the Lord is compassionate and merciful; he forgives
sins and saves in time of affliction.
<br>[<b>12</b>] Woe to timid hearts and to slack hands, and to the sinner
who walks along two ways!
<br>[<b>13</b>] Woe to the faint heart, for it has no trust! Therefore
it will not be sheltered.
<br>[<b>14</b>] Woe to you who have lost your endurance! What will you
do when the Lord punishes you?
<br>[<b>15</b>] Those who fear the Lord will not disobey his words, and
those who love him will keep his ways.
<br>[<b>16</b>] Those who fear the Lord will seek his approval, and those
who love him will be filled with the law.
<br>[<b>17</b>] Those who fear the Lord will prepare their hearts, and
will humble themselves before him.
<br>[<b>18</b>] Let us fall into the hands of the Lord, but not into the
hands of men; for as his majesty is, so also is his mercy.
<p>
<hr>
<h3>
Sir.3</h3>
[<b>1</b>] Listen to me your father, O children; and act accordingly, that
you may be kept in safety.
<br>[<b>2</b>] For the Lord honored the father above the children, and
he confirmed the right of the mother over her sons.
<br>[<b>3</b>] Whoever honors his father atones for sins,
<br>[<b>4</b>] and whoever glorifies his mother is like one who lays up
treasure.
<br>[<b>5</b>] Whoever honors his father will be gladdened by his own children,
and when he prays he will be heard.
<br>[<b>6</b>] Whoever glorifies his father will have long life, and whoever
obeys the Lord will refresh his mother;
<br>[<b>7</b>] he will serve his parents as his masters.
<br>[<b>8</b>] Honor your father by word and deed, that a blessing from
him may come upon you.
<br>[<b>9</b>] For a father's blessing strengthens the houses of the children,
but a mother's curse uproots their foundations.
<br>[<b>10</b>] Do not glorify yourself by dishonoring your father, for
your father's dishonor is no glory to you.
<br>[<b>11</b>] For a man's glory comes from honoring his father, and it
is a disgrace for children not to respect their mother.
<br>[<b>12</b>] O son, help your father in his old age, and do not grieve
him as long as he lives;
<br>[<b>13</b>] even if he is lacking in understanding, show forbearance;
in all your strength do not despise him.
<br>[<b>14</b>] For kindness to a father will not be forgotten, and against
your sins it will be credited to you;
<br>[<b>15</b>] in the day of your affliction it will be remembered in
your favor; as frost in fair weather, your sins will melt away.
<br>[<b>16</b>] Whoever forsakes his father is like a blasphemer, and whoever
angers his mother is cursed by the Lord.
<br>[<b>17</b>] My son, perform your tasks in meekness; then you will be
loved by those whom God accepts.
<br>[<b>18</b>] The greater you are, the more you must humble yourself;
so you will find favor in the sight of the Lord.
<br>[<b>20</b>] For great is the might of the Lord; he is glorified by
the humble.
<br>[<b>21</b>] Seek not what is too difficult for you, nor investigate
what is beyond your power.
<br>[<b>22</b>] Reflect upon what has been assigned to you, for you do
not need what is hidden.
<br>[<b>23</b>] Do not meddle in what is beyond your tasks, for matters
too great for human understanding have been shown you.
<br>[<b>24</b>] For their hasty judgment has led many astray, and wrong
opinion has caused their thoughts to slip.
<br>[<b>26</b>] A stubborn mind will be afflicted at the end, and whoever
loves danger will perish by it.
<br>[<b>27</b>] A stubborn mind will be burdened by troubles, and the sinner
will heap sin upon sin.
<br>[<b>28</b>] The affliction of the proud has no healing, for a plant
of wickedness has taken root in him.
<br>[<b>29</b>] The mind of the intelligent man will ponder a parable,
and an attentive ear is the wise man's desire.
<br>[<b>30</b>] Water extinguishes a blazing fire: so almsgiving atones
for sin.
<br>[<b>31</b>] Whoever requites favors gives thought to the future; at
the moment of his falling he will find support.
<p>
<hr>
<h3>
Sir.4</h3>
[<b>1</b>] My son, deprive not the poor of his living, and do not keep
needy eyes waiting.
<br>[<b>2</b>] Do not grieve the one who is hungry, nor anger a man in
want.
<br>[<b>3</b>] Do not add to the troubles of an angry mind, nor delay your
gift to a beggar.
<br>[<b>4</b>] Do not reject an afflicted suppliant, nor turn your face
away from the poor.
<br>[<b>5</b>] Do not avert your eye from the needy, nor give a man occasion
to curse you;
<br>[<b>6</b>] for if in bitterness of soul he calls down a curse upon
you, his Creator will hear his prayer.
<br>[<b>7</b>] Make yourself beloved in the congregation; bow your head
low to a great man.
<br>[<b>8</b>] Incline your ear to the poor, and answer him peaceably and
gently.
<br>[<b>9</b>] Deliver him who is wronged from the hand of the wrongdoer;
and do not be fainthearted in judging a case.
<br>[<b>10</b>] Be like a father to orphans, and instead of a husband to
their mother; you will then be like a son of the Most High,
<br>and he will love you more than does your mother.
<br>[<b>11</b>] Wisdom exalts her sons and gives help to those who seek
her.
<br>[<b>12</b>] Whoever loves her loves life, and those who seek her early
will be filled with joy.
<br>[<b>13</b>] Whoever holds her fast will obtain glory, and the Lord
will bless the place she enters.
<br>[<b>14</b>] Those who serve her will minister to the Holy One; the
Lord loves those who love her.
<br>[<b>15</b>] He who obeys her will judge the nations, and whoever gives
heed to her will dwell secure.
<br>[<b>16</b>] If he has faith in her he will obtain her; and his descendants
will remain in possession of her.
<br>[<b>17</b>] For at first she will walk with him on tortuous paths,
she will bring fear and cowardice upon him, and will torment him by her
discipline until she trusts him, and she will test him with her ordinances.
<br>[<b>18</b>] Then she will come straight back to him and gladden him,
and will reveal her secrets to him.
<br>[<b>19</b>] If he goes astray she will forsake him, and hand him over
to his ruin.
<br>[<b>20</b>] Observe the right time, and beware of evil; and do not
bring shame on yourself.
<br>[<b>21</b>] For there is a shame which brings sin, and there is a shame
which is glory and favor.
<br>[<b>22</b>] Do not show partiality, to your own harm, or deference,
to your downfall.
<br>[<b>23</b>] Do not refrain from speaking at the crucial time, and do
not hide your wisdom.
<br>[<b>24</b>] For wisdom is known through speech, and education through
the words of the tongue.
<br>[<b>25</b>] Never speak against the truth, but be mindful of your ignorance.
<br>[<b>26</b>] Do not be ashamed to confess your sins, and do not try
to stop the current of a river.
<br>[<b>27</b>] Do not subject yourself to a foolish fellow, nor show partiality
to a ruler.
<br>[<b>28</b>] Strive even to death for the truth and the Lord God will
fight for you.
<br>[<b>29</b>] Do not be reckless in your speech, or sluggish and remiss
in your deeds.
<br>[<b>30</b>] Do not be like a lion in your home, nor be a faultfinder
with your servants.
<br>[<b>31</b>] Let not your hand be extended to receive, but withdrawn
when it is time to repay.
<p>
<hr>
<h3>
Sir.5</h3>
[<b>1</b>] Do not set your heart on your wealth, nor say, &quot;I have enough.&quot;
<br>[<b>2</b>] Do not follow your inclination and strength, walking according
to the desires of your heart.
<br>[<b>3</b>] Do not say, &quot;Who will have power over me?&quot; for the Lord
will surely punish you.
<br>[<b>4</b>] Do not say, &quot;I sinned, and what happened to me?&quot; for the
Lord is slow to anger.
<br>[<b>5</b>] Do not be so confident of atonement that you add sin to
sin.
<br>[<b>6</b>] Do not say, &quot;His mercy is great, he will forgive the multitude
of my sins,&quot; for both mercy and wrath are with him,
<br>and his anger rests on sinners.
<br>[<b>7</b>] Do not delay to turn to the Lord, nor postpone it from day
to day; for suddenly the wrath of the Lord will go forth,
<br>and at the time of punishment you will perish.
<br>[<b>8</b>] Do not depend on dishonest wealth, for it will not benefit
you in the day of calamity.
<br>[<b>9</b>] Do not winnow with every wind, nor follow every path: the
double-tongued sinner does that.
<br>[<b>10</b>] Be steadfast in your understanding, and let your speech
be consistent.
<br>[<b>11</b>] Be quick to hear, and be deliberate in answering.
<br>[<b>12</b>] If you have understanding, answer your neighbor; but if
not, put your hand on your mouth.
<br>[<b>13</b>] Glory and dishonor come from speaking, and a man's tongue
is his downfall.
<br>[<b>14</b>] Do not be called a slanderer, and do not lie in ambush
with your tongue; for shame comes to the thief, and severe condemnation
to the double-tongued.
<br>[<b>15</b>] In great and small matters do not act amiss,
<p>
<hr>
<h3>
Sir.6</h3>
[<b>1</b>] and do not become an enemy instead of a friend; for a bad name
incurs shame and reproach: so fares the double-tongued sinner.
<br>[<b>2</b>] Do not exalt yourself through your soul's counsel, lest
your soul be torn in pieces like a bull.
<br>[<b>3</b>] You will devour your leaves and destroy your fruit, and
will be left like a withered tree.
<br>[<b>4</b>] An evil soul will destroy him who has it, and make him the
laughingstock of his enemies.
<br>[<b>5</b>] A pleasant voice multiplies friends, and a gracious tongue
multiplies courtesies.
<br>[<b>6</b>] Let those that are at peace with you be many, but let your
advisers be one in a thousand.
<br>[<b>7</b>] When you gain a friend, gain him through testing, and do
not trust him hastily.
<br>[<b>8</b>] For there is a friend who is such at his own convenience,
but will not stand by you in your day of trouble.
<br>[<b>9</b>] And there is a friend who changes into an enemy, and will
disclose a quarrel to your disgrace.
<br>[<b>10</b>] And there is a friend who is a table companion, but will
not stand by you in your day of trouble.
<br>[<b>11</b>] In prosperity he will make himself your equal, and be bold
with your servants;
<br>[<b>12</b>] but if you are brought low he will turn against you, and
will hide himself from your presence.
<br>[<b>13</b>] Keep yourself far from your enemies, and be on guard toward
your friends.
<br>[<b>14</b>] A faithful friend is a sturdy shelter: he that has found
one has found a treasure.
<br>[<b>15</b>] There is nothing so precious as a faithful friend, and
no scales can measure his excellence.
<br>[<b>16</b>] A faithful friend is an elixir of life; and those who fear
the Lord will find him.
<br>[<b>17</b>] Whoever fears the Lord directs his friendship aright, for
as he is, so is his neighbor also.
<br>[<b>18</b>] My son, from your youth up choose instruction, and until
you are old you will keep finding wisdom.
<br>[<b>19</b>] Come to her like one who plows and sows, and wait for her
good harvest. For in her service you will toil a little while, and soon
you will eat of her produce.
<br>[<b>20</b>] She seems very harsh to the uninstructed; a weakling will
not remain with her.
<br>[<b>21</b>] She will weigh him down like a heavy testing stone, and
he will not be slow to cast her off.
<br>[<b>22</b>] For wisdom is like her name, and is not manifest to many.
<br>[<b>23</b>] Listen, my son, and accept my judgment; do not reject my
counsel.
<br>[<b>24</b>] Put your feet into her fetters, and your neck into her
collar.
<br>[<b>25</b>] Put your shoulder under her and carry her, and do not fret
under her bonds.
<br>[<b>26</b>] Come to her with all your soul, and keep her ways with
all your might.
<br>[<b>27</b>] Search out and seek, and she will become known to you;
and when you get hold of her, do not let her go.
<br>[<b>28</b>] For at last you will find the rest she gives, and she will
be changed into joy for you.
<br>[<b>29</b>] Then her fetters will become for you a strong protection,
and her collar a glorious robe.
<br>[<b>30</b>] Her yoke is a golden ornament, and her bonds are a cord
of blue.
<br>[<b>31</b>] You will wear her like a glorious robe, and put her on
like a crown of gladness.
<br>[<b>32</b>] If you are willing, my son, you will be taught, and if
you apply yourself you will become clever.
<br>[<b>33</b>] If you love to listen you will gain knowledge, and if you
incline your ear you will become wise.
<br>[<b>34</b>] Stand in the assembly of the elders. Who is wise? Cleave
to him.
<br>[<b>35</b>] Be ready to listen to every narrative, and do not let wise
proverbs escape you.
<br>[<b>36</b>] If you see an intelligent man, visit him early; let your
foot wear out his doorstep.
<br>[<b>37</b>] Reflect on the statutes of the Lord, and meditate at all
times on his commandments. It is he who will give insight to your mind,
and your desire for wisdom will be granted.
<p>
<hr>
<h3>
Sir.7</h3>
[<b>1</b>] Do no evil, and evil will never befall you.
<br>[<b>2</b>] Stay away from wrong, and it will turn away from you.
<br>[<b>3</b>] My son, do not sow the furrows of injustice, and you will
not reap a sevenfold crop.
<br>[<b>4</b>] Do not seek from the Lord the highest office, nor the seat
of honor from the king.
<br>[<b>5</b>] Do not assert your righteousness before the Lord, nor display
your wisdom before the king.
<br>[<b>6</b>] Do not seek to become a judge, lest you be unable to remove
iniquity, lest you be partial to a powerful man, and thus put a blot on
your integrity.
<br>[<b>7</b>] Do not offend against the public, and do not disgrace yourself
among the people.
<br>[<b>8</b>] Do not commit a sin twice; even for one you will not go
unpunished.
<br>[<b>9</b>] Do not say, &quot;He will consider the multitude of my gifts,
and when I make an offering to the Most High God he will accept it.&quot;
<br>[<b>10</b>] Do not be fainthearted in your prayer, nor neglect to give
alms.
<br>[<b>11</b>] Do not ridicule a man who is bitter in soul, for there
is One who abases and exalts.
<br>[<b>12</b>] Do not devise a lie against your brother, nor do the like
to a friend.
<br>[<b>13</b>] Refuse to utter any lie, for the habit of lying serves
no good.
<br>[<b>14</b>] Do not prattle in the assembly of the elders, nor repeat
yourself in your prayer.
<br>[<b>15</b>] Do not hate toilsome labor, or farm work, which were created
by the Most High.
<br>[<b>16</b>] Do not count yourself among the crowd of sinners; remember
that wrath does not delay.
<br>[<b>17</b>] Humble yourself greatly, for the punishment of the ungodly
is fire and worms.
<br>[<b>18</b>] Do not exchange a friend for money, or a real brother for
the gold of Ophir.
<br>[<b>19</b>] Do not deprive yourself of a wise and good wife, for her
charm is worth more than gold.
<br>[<b>20</b>] Do not abuse a servant who performs his work faithfully,
or a hired laborer who devotes himself to you.
<br>[<b>21</b>] Let your soul love an intelligent servant; do not withhold
from him his freedom.
<br>[<b>22</b>] Do you have cattle? Look after them; if they are profitable
to you, keep them.
<br>[<b>23</b>] Do you have children? Discipline them, and make them obedient
from their youth.
<br>[<b>24</b>] Do you have daughters? Be concerned for their chastity,
and do not show yourself too indulgent with them.
<br>[<b>25</b>] Give a daughter in marriage; you will have finished a great
task. But give her to a man of understanding.
<br>[<b>26</b>] If you have a wife who pleases you, do not cast her out;
but do not trust yourself to one whom you detest.
<br>[<b>27</b>] With all your heart honor your father, and do not forget
the birth pangs of your mother.
<br>[<b>28</b>] Remember that through your parents you were born; and what
can you give back to them that equals their gift to you?
<br>[<b>29</b>] With all your soul fear the Lord, and honor his priests.
<br>[<b>30</b>] With all your might love your Maker, and do not forsake
his ministers.
<br>[<b>31</b>] Fear the Lord and honor the priest, and give him his portion,
as is commanded you: the first fruits, the guilt offering, the gift of
the shoulders, the sacrifice of sanctification, and the first fruits of
the holy things.
<br>[<b>32</b>] Stretch forth your hand to the poor, so that your blessing
may be complete.
<br>[<b>33</b>] Give graciously to all the living, and withhold not kindness
from the dead.
<br>[<b>34</b>] Do not fail those who weep, but mourn with those who mourn.
<br>[<b>35</b>] Do not shrink from visiting a sick man, because for such
deeds you will be loved.
<br>[<b>36</b>] In all you do, remember the end of your life, and then
you will never sin.
<p>
<hr>
<h3>
Sir.8</h3>
[<b>1</b>] Do not contend with a powerful man, lest you fall into his hands.
<br>[<b>2</b>] Do not quarrel with a rich man, lest his resources outweigh
yours; for gold has ruined many, and has perverted the minds of kings.
<br>[<b>3</b>] Do not argue with a chatterer, nor heap wood on his fire.
<br>[<b>4</b>] Do not jest with an ill-bred person, lest your ancestors
be disgraced.
<br>[<b>5</b>] Do not reproach a man who is turning away from sin; remember
that we all deserve punishment.
<br>[<b>6</b>] Do not disdain a man when he is old, for some of us are
growing old.
<br>[<b>7</b>] Do not rejoice over any one's death; remember that we all
must die.
<br>[<b>8</b>] Do not slight the discourse of the sages, but busy yourself
with their maxims; because from them you will gain instruction and learn
how to serve great men.
<br>[<b>9</b>] Do not disregard the discourse of the aged, for they themselves
learned from their fathers; because from them you will gain understanding
and learn how to give an answer in time of need.
<br>[<b>10</b>] Do not kindle the coals of a sinner, lest you be burned
in his flaming fire.
<br>[<b>11</b>] Do not get up and leave an insolent fellow, lest he lie
in ambush against your words.
<br>[<b>12</b>] Do not lend to a man who is stronger than you; but if you
do lend anything, be as one who has lost it.
<br>[<b>13</b>] Do not give surety beyond your means, but if you give surety,
be concerned as one who must pay.
<br>[<b>14</b>] Do not go to law against a judge, for the decision will
favor him because of his standing.
<br>[<b>15</b>] Do not travel on the road with a foolhardy fellow, lest
he be burdensome to you; for he will act as he pleases, and through his
folly you will perish with him.
<br>[<b>16</b>] Do not fight with a wrathful man, and do not cross the
wilderness with him; because blood is as nothing in his sight,
<br>and where no help is at hand, he will strike you down.
<br>[<b>17</b>] Do not consult with a fool, for he will not be able to
keep a secret.
<br>[<b>18</b>] In the presence of a stranger do nothing that is to be
kept secret, for you do not know what he will divulge.
<br>[<b>19</b>] Do not reveal your thoughts to every one, lest you drive
away your good luck.
<p>
<hr>
<h3>
Sir.9</h3>
[<b>1</b>] Do not be jealous of the wife of your bosom, and do not teach
her an evil lesson to your own hurt.
<br>[<b>2</b>] Do not give yourself to a woman so that she gains mastery
over your strength.
<br>[<b>3</b>] Do not go to meet a loose woman, lest you fall into her
snares.
<br>[<b>4</b>] Do not associate with a woman singer, lest you be caught
in her intrigues.
<br>[<b>5</b>] Do not look intently at a virgin, lest you stumble and incur
penalties for her.
<br>[<b>6</b>] Do not give yourself to harlots lest you lose your inheritance.
<br>[<b>7</b>] Do not look around in the streets of a city, nor wander
about in its deserted sections.
<br>[<b>8</b>] Turn away your eyes from a shapely woman, and do not look
intently at beauty belonging to another; many have been misled by a woman's
beauty, and by it passion is kindled like a fire.
<br>[<b>9</b>] Never dine with another man's wife, nor revel with her at
wine; lest your heart turn aside to her, and in blood you be plunged into
destruction.
<br>[<b>10</b>] Forsake not an old friend, for a new one does not compare
with him. A new friend is like new wine; when it has aged you will drink
it with pleasure.
<br>[<b>11</b>] Do not envy the honors of a sinner, for you do not know
what his end will be.
<br>[<b>12</b>] Do not delight in what pleases the ungodly; remember that
they will not be held guiltless as long as they live.
<br>[<b>13</b>] Keep far from a man who has the power to kill, and you
will not be worried by the fear of death. But if you approach him, make
no misstep, lest he rob you of your life. Know that you are walking in
the midst of snares, and that you are going about on the city battlements.
<br>[<b>14</b>] As much as you can, aim to know your neighbors, and consult
with the wise.
<br>[<b>15</b>] Let your conversation be with men of understanding, and
let all your discussion be about the law of the Most High.
<br>[<b>16</b>] Let righteous men be your dinner companions, and let your
glorying be in the fear of the Lord.
<br>[<b>17</b>] A work will be praised for the skill of the craftsmen;
so a people's leader is proved wise by his words.
<br>[<b>18</b>] A babbler is feared in his city, and the man who is reckless
in speech will be hated.

<h3>
Sir.10</h3>
[<b>1</b>] A wise magistrate will educate his people, and the rule of an
understanding man will be well ordered.
<br>[<b>2</b>] Like the magistrate of the people, so are his officials;
and like the ruler of the city, so are all its inhabitants.
<br>[<b>3</b>] An undisciplined king will ruin his people, but a city will
grow through the understanding of its rulers.
<br>[<b>4</b>] The government of the earth is in the hands of the Lord,
and over it he will raise up the right man for the time.
<br>[<b>5</b>] The success of a man is in the hands of the Lord, and he
confers his honor upon the person of the scribe.
<br>[<b>6</b>] Do not be angry with your neighbor for any injury, and do
not attempt anything by acts of insolence.
<br>[<b>7</b>] Arrogance is hateful before the Lord and before men, and
injustice is outrageous to both.
<br>[<b>8</b>] Sovereignty passes from nation to nation on account of injustice
and insolence and wealth.
<br>[<b>9</b>] How can he who is dust and ashes be proud? for even in life
his bowels decay.
<br>[<b>10</b>] A long illness baffles the physician; the king of today
will die tomorrow.
<br>[<b>11</b>] For when a man is dead, he will inherit creeping things,
and wild beasts, and worms.
<br>[<b>12</b>] The beginning of man's pride is to depart from the Lord;
his heart has forsaken his Maker.
<br>[<b>13</b>] For the beginning of pride is sin, and the man who clings
to it pours out abominations. Therefore the Lord brought upon them extraordinary
afflictions, and destroyed them utterly.
<br>[<b>14</b>] The Lord has cast down the thrones of rulers, and has seated
the lowly in their place.
<br>[<b>15</b>] The Lord has plucked up the roots of the nations, and has
planted the humble in their place.
<br>[<b>16</b>] The Lord has overthrown the lands of the nations, and has
destroyed them to the foundations of the earth.
<br>[<b>17</b>] He has removed some of them and destroyed them, and has
extinguished the memory of them from the earth.
<br>[<b>18</b>] Pride was not created for men, nor fierce anger for those
born of women.
<br>[<b>19</b>] What race is worthy of honor? The human race. What race
is worthy of honor? Those who fear the Lord. What race is unworthy of honor?
The human race. What race is unworthy of honor? Those who transgress the
commandments.
<br>[<b>20</b>] Among brothers their leader is worthy of honor, and those
who fear the Lord are worthy of honor in his eyes.
<br>[<b>22</b>] The rich, and the eminent, and the poor -- their glory
is the fear of the Lord.
<br>[<b>23</b>] It is not right to despise an intelligent poor man, nor
is it proper to honor a sinful man.
<br>[<b>24</b>] The nobleman, and the judge, and the ruler will be honored,
but none of them is greater than the man who fears the Lord.
<br>[<b>25</b>] Free men will be at the service of a wise servant, and
a man of understanding will not grumble.
<br>[<b>26</b>] Do not make a display of your wisdom when you do your work,
nor glorify yourself at a time when you are in want.
<br>[<b>27</b>] Better is a man who works and has an abundance of everything,
than one who goes about boasting, but lacks bread.
<br>[<b>28</b>] My son, glorify yourself with humility, and ascribe to
yourself honor according to your worth.
<br>[<b>29</b>] Who will justify the man that sins against himself? And
who will honor the man that dishonors his own life?
<br>[<b>30</b>] A poor man is honored for his knowledge, while a rich man
is honored for his wealth.
<br>[<b>31</b>] A man honored in poverty, how much more in wealth! And
a man dishonored in wealth, how much more in poverty!
<p>
<hr>
<h3>
Sir.11</h3>
[<b>1</b>] The wisdom of a humble man will lift up his head, and will seat
him among the great.
<br>[<b>2</b>] Do not praise a man for his good looks, nor loathe a man
because of his appearance.
<br>[<b>3</b>] The bee is small among flying creatures, but her product
is the best of sweet things.
<br>[<b>4</b>] Do not boast about wearing fine clothes, nor exalt yourself
in the day that you are honored; for the works of the Lord are wonderful,
and his works are concealed from men.
<br>[<b>5</b>] Many kings have had to sit on the ground, but one who was
never thought of has worn a crown.
<br>[<b>6</b>] Many rulers have been greatly disgraced, and illustrious
men have been handed over to others.
<br>[<b>7</b>] Do not find fault before you investigate; first consider,
and then reprove.
<br>[<b>8</b>] Do not answer before you have heard, nor interrupt a speaker
in the midst of his words.
<br>[<b>9</b>] Do not argue about a matter which does not concern you,
nor sit with sinners when they judge a case.
<br>[<b>10</b>] My son, do not busy yourself with many matters; if you
multiply activities you will not go unpunished, and if you pursue you will
not overtake, and by fleeing you will not escape.
<br>[<b>11</b>] There is a man who works, and toils, and presses on, but
is so much the more in want.
<br>[<b>12</b>] There is another who is slow and needs help, who lacks
strength and abounds in poverty; but the eyes of the Lord look upon him
for his good; he lifts him out of his low estate
<br>[<b>13</b>] and raises up his head, so that many are amazed at him.
<br>[<b>14</b>] Good things and bad, life and death, poverty and wealth,
come from the Lord.
<br>[<b>17</b>] The gift of the Lord endures for those who are godly, and
what he approves will have lasting success.
<br>[<b>18</b>] There is a man who is rich through his diligence and self-denial,
and this is the reward allotted to him:
<br>[<b>19</b>] when he says, &quot;I have found rest, and now I shall enjoy
my goods!&quot; he does not know how much time will pass
<br>until he leaves them to others and dies.
<br>[<b>20</b>] Stand by your covenant and attend to it, and grow old in
your work.
<br>[<b>21</b>] Do not wonder at the works of a sinner, but trust in the
Lord and keep at your toil; for it is easy in the sight of the Lord to
enrich a poor man quickly and suddenly.
<br>[<b>22</b>] The blessing of the Lord is the reward of the godly, and
quickly God causes his blessing to flourish.
<br>[<b>23</b>] Do not say, &quot;What do I need, and what prosperity could
be mine in the future?&quot;
<br>[<b>24</b>] Do not say, &quot;I have enough, and what calamity could happen
to me in the future?&quot;
<br>[<b>25</b>] In the day of prosperity, adversity is forgotten, and in
the day of adversity, prosperity is not remembered.
<br>[<b>26</b>] For it is easy in the sight of the Lord to reward a man
on the day of death according to his conduct.
<br>[<b>27</b>] The misery of an hour makes one forget luxury, and at the
close of a man's life his deeds will be revealed.
<br>[<b>28</b>] Call no one happy before his death; a man will be known
through his children.
<br>[<b>29</b>] Do not bring every man into your home, for many are the
wiles of the crafty.
<br>[<b>30</b>] Like a decoy partridge in a cage, so is the mind of a proud
man, and like a spy he observes your weakness;
<br>[<b>31</b>] for he lies in wait, turning good into evil, and to worthy
actions he will attach blame.
<br>[<b>32</b>] From a spark of fire come many burning coals, and a sinner
lies in wait to shed blood.
<br>[<b>33</b>] Beware of a scoundrel, for he devises evil, lest he give
you a lasting blemish.
<br>[<b>34</b>] Receive a stranger into your home and he will upset you
with commotion, and will estrange you from your family.
<p>
<hr>
<h3>
Sir.12</h3>
[<b>1</b>] If you do a kindness, know to whom you do it, and you will be
thanked for your good deeds.
<br>[<b>2</b>] Do good to a godly man, and you will be repaid --if not
by him, certainly by the Most High.
<br>[<b>3</b>] No good will come to the man who persists in evil or to
him who does not give alms.
<br>[<b>4</b>] Give to the godly man, but do not help the sinner.
<br>[<b>5</b>] Do good to the humble, but do not give to the ungodly; hold
back his bread, and do not give it to him, lest by means of it he subdue
you; for you will receive twice as much evil for all the good which you
do to him.
<br>[<b>6</b>] For the Most High also hates sinners and will inflict punishment
on the ungodly.
<br>[<b>7</b>] Give to the good man, but do not help the sinner.
<br>[<b>8</b>] A friend will not be known in prosperity, nor will an enemy
be hidden in adversity.
<br>[<b>9</b>] A man's enemies are grieved when he prospers, and in his
adversity even his friend will separate from him.
<br>[<b>10</b>] Never trust your enemy, for like the rusting of copper,
so is his wickedness.
<br>[<b>11</b>] Even if he humbles himself and goes about cringing, watch
yourself, and be on your guard against him; and you will be to him like
one who has polished a mirror, and you will know that it was not hopelessly
tarnished.
<br>[<b>12</b>] Do not put him next to you, lest he overthrow you and take
your place; do not have him sit at your right, lest he try to take your
seat of honor, and at last you will realize the truth of my words, and
be stung by what I have said.
<br>[<b>13</b>] Who will pity a snake charmer bitten by a serpent, or any
who go near wild beasts?
<br>[<b>14</b>] So no one will pity a man who associates with a sinner
and becomes involved in his sins.
<br>[<b>15</b>] He will stay with you for a time, but if you falter, he
will not stand by you.
<br>[<b>16</b>] An enemy will speak sweetly with his lips, but in his mind
he will plan to throw you into a pit; an enemy will weep with his eyes,
but if he finds an opportunity his thirst for blood will be insatiable.
<br>[<b>17</b>] If calamity befalls you, you will find him there ahead
of you; and while pretending to help you, he will trip you by the heel;
<br>[<b>18</b>] he will shake his head, and clap his hands, and whisper
much, and change his expression.
<p>
<hr>
<h3>
Sir.13</h3>
[<b>1</b>] Whoever touches pitch will be defiled, and whoever associates
with a proud man will become like him.
<br>[<b>2</b>] Do not lift a weight beyond your strength, nor associate
with a man mightier and richer than you. How can the clay pot associate
with the iron kettle? The pot will strike against it, and will itself be
broken.
<br>[<b>3</b>] A rich man does wrong, and he even adds reproaches; a poor
man suffers wrong, and he must add apologies.
<br>[<b>4</b>] A rich man will exploit you if you can be of use to him,
but if you are in need he will forsake you.
<br>[<b>5</b>] If you own something, he will live with you; he will drain
your resources and he will not care.
<br>[<b>6</b>] When he needs you he will deceive you, he will smile at
you and give you hope. He will speak to you kindly and say, &quot;What do you
need?&quot;
<br>[<b>7</b>] He will shame you with his foods, until he has drained you
two or three times; and finally he will deride you. Should he see you afterwards,
he will forsake you, and shake his head at you.
<br>[<b>8</b>] Take care not to be led astray, and not to be humiliated
in your feasting.
<br>[<b>9</b>] When a powerful man invites you, be reserved; and he will
invite you the more often.
<br>[<b>10</b>] Do not push forward, lest you be repulsed; and do not remain
at a distance, lest you be forgotten.
<br>[<b>11</b>] Do not try to treat him as an equal, nor trust his abundance
of words; for he will test you through much talk, and while he smiles he
will be examining you.
<br>[<b>12</b>] Cruel is he who does not keep words to himself; he will
not hesitate to injure or to imprison.
<br>[<b>13</b>] Keep words to yourself and be very watchful, for you are
walking about with your own downfall.
<br>[<b>15</b>] Every creature loves its like, and every person his neighbor;
<br>[<b>16</b>] all living beings associate by species, and a man clings
to one like himself.
<br>[<b>17</b>] What fellowship has a wolf with a lamb? No more has a sinner
with a godly man.
<br>[<b>18</b>] What peace is there between a hyena and a dog? And what
peace between a rich man and a poor man?
<br>[<b>19</b>] Wild asses in the wilderness are the prey of lions; likewise
the poor are pastures for the rich.
<br>[<b>20</b>] Humility is an abomination to a proud man; likewise a poor
man is an abomination to a rich one.
<br>[<b>21</b>] When a rich man totters, he is steadied by friends, but
when a humble man falls, he is even pushed away by friends.
<br>[<b>22</b>] If a rich man slips, his helpers are many; he speaks unseemly
words, and they justify him. If a humble man slips, they even reproach
him; he speaks sensibly, and receives no attention.
<br>[<b>23</b>] When the rich man speaks all are silent, and they extol
to the clouds what he says. When the poor man speaks they say, &quot;Who is
this fellow?&quot; And should he stumble, they even push him down.
<br>[<b>24</b>] Riches are good if they are free from sin, and poverty
is evil in the opinion of the ungodly.
<br>[<b>25</b>] A man's heart changes his countenance, either for good
or for evil.
<br>[<b>26</b>] The mark of a happy heart is a cheerful face, but to devise
proverbs requires painful thinking.
<p>
<hr>
<h3>
Sir.14</h3>
[<b>1</b>] Blessed is the man who does not blunder with his lips and need
not suffer grief for sin.
<br>[<b>2</b>] Blessed is he whose heart does not condemn him, and who
has not given up his hope.
<br>[<b>3</b>] Riches are not seemly for a stingy man; and of what use
is property to an envious man?
<br>[<b>4</b>] Whoever accumulates by depriving himself, accumulates for
others; and others will live in luxury on his goods.
<br>[<b>5</b>] If a man is mean to himself, to whom will he be generous?
He will not enjoy his own riches.
<br>[<b>6</b>] No one is meaner than the man who is grudging to himself,
and this is the retribution for his baseness;
<br>[<b>7</b>] even if he does good, he does it unintentionally, and betrays
his baseness in the end.
<br>[<b>8</b>] Evil is the man with a grudging eye; he averts his face
and disregards people.
<br>[<b>9</b>] A greedy man's eye is not satisfied with a portion, and
mean injustice withers the soul.
<br>[<b>10</b>] A stingy man's eye begrudges bread, and it is lacking at
his table.
<br>[<b>11</b>] My son, treat yourself well, according to your means, and
present worthy offerings to the Lord.
<br>[<b>12</b>] Remember that death will not delay, and the decree of Hades
has not been shown to you.
<br>[<b>13</b>] Do good to a friend before you die, and reach out and give
to him as much as you can.
<br>[<b>14</b>] Do not deprive yourself of a happy day; let not your share
of desired good pass by you.
<br>[<b>15</b>] Will you not leave the fruit of your labors to another,
and what you acquired by toil to be divided by lot?
<br>[<b>16</b>] Give, and take, and beguile yourself, because in Hades
one cannot look for luxury.
<br>[<b>17</b>] All living beings become old like a garment, for the decree
from of old is, &quot;You must surely die!&quot;
<br>[<b>18</b>] Like flourishing leaves on a spreading tree which sheds
some and puts forth others, so are the generations of flesh and blood:
one dies and another is born.
<br>[<b>19</b>] Every product decays and ceases to exist, and the man who
made it will pass away with it.
<br>[<b>20</b>] Blessed is the man who meditates on wisdom and who reasons
intelligently.
<br>[<b>21</b>] He who reflects in his mind on her ways will also ponder
her secrets.
<br>[<b>22</b>] Pursue wisdom like a hunter, and lie in wait on her paths.
<br>[<b>23</b>] He who peers through her windows will also listen at her
doors;
<br>[<b>24</b>] he who encamps near her house will also fasten his tent
peg to her walls;
<br>[<b>25</b>] he will pitch his tent near her, and will lodge in an excellent
lodging place;
<br>[<b>26</b>] he will place his children under her shelter, and will
camp under her boughs;
<br>[<b>27</b>] he will be sheltered by her from the heat, and will dwell
in the midst of her glory.
<p>
<hr>
<h3>
Sir.15</h3>
[<b>1</b>] The man who fears the Lord will do this, and he who holds to
the law will obtain wisdom.
<br>[<b>2</b>] She will come to meet him like a mother, and like the wife
of his youth she will welcome him.
<br>[<b>3</b>] She will feed him with the bread of understanding, and give
him the water of wisdom to drink.
<br>[<b>4</b>] He will lean on her and will not fall, and he will rely
on her and will not be put to shame.
<br>[<b>5</b>] She will exalt him above his neighbors, and will open his
mouth in the midst of the assembly.
<br>[<b>6</b>] He will find gladness and a crown of rejoicing, and will
acquire an everlasting name.
<br>[<b>7</b>] Foolish men will not obtain her, and sinful men will not
see her.
<br>[<b>8</b>] She is far from men of pride, and liars will never think
of her.
<br>[<b>9</b>] A hymn of praise is not fitting on the lips of a sinner,
for it has not been sent from the Lord.
<br>[<b>10</b>] For a hymn of praise should be uttered in wisdom, and the
Lord will prosper it.
<br>[<b>11</b>] Do not say, &quot;Because of the Lord I left the right way&quot;;
for he will not do what he hates.
<br>[<b>12</b>] Do not say, &quot;It was he who led me astray&quot;; for he had no
need of a sinful man.
<br>[<b>13</b>] The Lord hates all abominations, and they are not loved
by those who fear him.
<br>[<b>14</b>] It was he who created man in the beginning, and he left
him in the power of his own inclination.
<br>[<b>15</b>] If you will, you can keep the commandments, and to act
faithfully is a matter of your own choice.
<br>[<b>16</b>] He has placed before you fire and water: stretch out your
hand for whichever you wish.
<br>[<b>17</b>] Before a man are life and death, and whichever he chooses
will be given to him.
<br>[<b>18</b>] For great is the wisdom of the Lord; he is mighty in power
and sees everything;
<br>[<b>19</b>] his eyes are on those who fear him, and he knows every
deed of man.
<br>[<b>20</b>] He has not commanded any one to be ungodly, and he has
not given any one permission to sin.
<p>
<hr>
<h3>
Sir.16</h3>
[<b>1</b>] Do not desire a multitude of useless children, nor rejoice in
ungodly sons.
<br>[<b>2</b>] If they multiply , do not rejoice in them, unless the fear
of the Lord is in them.
<br>[<b>3</b>] Do not trust in their survival, and do not rely on their
multitude; for one is better than a thousand, and to die childless is better
than to have ungodly children.
<br>[<b>4</b>] For through one man of understanding a city will be filled
with people, but through a tribe of lawless men it will be made desolate.
<br>[<b>5</b>] Many such things my eye has seen, and my ear has heard things
more striking than these.
<br>[<b>6</b>] In an assembly of sinners a fire will be kindled, and in
a disobedient nation wrath was kindled.
<br>[<b>7</b>] He was not propitiated for the ancient giants who revolted
in their might.
<br>[<b>8</b>] He did not spare the neighbors of Lot, whom he loathed on
account of their insolence.
<br>[<b>9</b>] He showed no pity for a nation devoted to destruction, for
those destroyed in their sins;
<br>[<b>10</b>] nor for the six hundred thousand men on foot, who rebelliously
assembled in their stubbornness.
<br>[<b>11</b>] Even if there is only one stiff-necked person, it will
be a wonder if he remains unpunished. For mercy and wrath are with the
Lord; he is mighty to forgive, and he pours out wrath.
<br>[<b>12</b>] As great as his mercy, so great is also his reproof; he
judges a man according to his deeds.
<br>[<b>13</b>] The sinner will not escape with his plunder, and the patience
of the godly will not be frustrated.
<br>[<b>14</b>] He will make room for every act of mercy; every one will
receive in accordance with his deeds.
<br>[<b>17</b>] Do not say, &quot;I shall be hidden from the Lord, and who from
on high will remember me? Among so many people I shall not be known, for
what is my soul in the boundless creation?
<br>[<b>18</b>] Behold, heaven and the highest heaven, the abyss and the
earth, will tremble at his visitation.
<br>[<b>19</b>] The mountains also and the foundations of the earth shake
with trembling when he looks upon them.
<br>[<b>20</b>] And no mind will reflect on this. Who will ponder his ways?
<br>[<b>21</b>] Like a tempest which no man can see, so most of his works
are concealed.
<br>[<b>22</b>] Who will announce his acts of justice? Or who will await
them? For the covenant is far off.&quot;
<br>[<b>23</b>] This is what one devoid of understanding thinks; a senseless
and misguided man thinks foolishly.
<br>[<b>24</b>] Listen to me, my son, and acquire knowledge, and pay close
attention to my words.
<br>[<b>25</b>] I will impart instruction by weight, and declare knowledge
accurately.
<br>[<b>26</b>] The works of the Lord have existed from the beginning by
his creation, and when he made them, he determined their divisions.
<br>[<b>27</b>] He arranged his works in an eternal order, and their dominion
for all generations; they neither hunger nor grow weary, and they do not
cease from their labors.
<br>[<b>28</b>] They do not crowd one another aside, and they will never
disobey his word.
<br>[<b>29</b>] After this the Lord looked upon the earth, and filled it
with his good things;
<br>[<b>30</b>] with all kinds of living beings he covered its surface,
and to it they return.
<p>
<hr>
<h3>
Sir.17</h3>
[<b>1</b>] The Lord created man out of earth, and turned him back to it
again.
<br>[<b>2</b>] He gave to men few days, a limited time, but granted them
authority over the things upon the earth.
<br>[<b>3</b>] He endowed them with strength like his own, and made them
in his own image.
<br>[<b>4</b>] He placed the fear of them in all living beings, and granted
them dominion over beasts and birds.
<br>[<b>6</b>] He made for them tongue and eyes; he gave them ears and
a mind for thinking.
<br>[<b>7</b>] He filled them with knowledge and understanding, and showed
them good and evil.
<br>[<b>8</b>] He set his eye upon their hearts to show them the majesty
of his works.
<br>[<b>10</b>] And they will praise his holy name, to proclaim the grandeur
of his works.
<br>[<b>11</b>] He bestowed knowledge upon them, and allotted to them the
law of life.
<br>[<b>12</b>] He established with them an eternal covenant, and showed
them his judgments.
<br>[<b>13</b>] Their eyes saw his glorious majesty, and their ears heard
the glory of his voice.
<br>[<b>14</b>] And he said to them, &quot;Beware of all unrighteousness.&quot; And
he gave commandment to each of them concerning
<br>his neighbor.
<br>[<b>15</b>] Their ways are always before him, they will not be hid
from his eyes.
<br>[<b>17</b>] He appointed a ruler for every nation, but Israel is the
Lord's own portion.
<br>[<b>19</b>] All their works are as the sun before him, and his eyes
are continually upon their ways.
<br>[<b>20</b>] Their iniquities are not hidden from him, and all their
sins are before the Lord.
<br>[<b>22</b>] A man's almsgiving is like a signet with the Lord and he
will keep a person's kindness like the apple of his eye.
<br>[<b>23</b>] Afterward he will arise and requite them, and he will bring
their recompense on their heads.
<br>[<b>24</b>] Yet to those who repent he grants a return, and he encourages
those whose endurance is failing.
<br>[<b>25</b>] Turn to the Lord and forsake your sins; pray in his presence
and lessen your offenses.
<br>[<b>26</b>] Return to the Most High and turn away from iniquity, and
hate abominations intensely.
<br>[<b>27</b>] Who will sing praises to the Most High in Hades, as do
those who are alive and give thanks?
<br>[<b>28</b>] From the dead, as from one who does not exist, thanksgiving
has ceased; he who is alive and well sings the Lord's praises.
<br>[<b>29</b>] How great is the mercy of the Lord, and his forgiveness
for those who turn to him!
<br>[<b>30</b>] For all things cannot be in men, since a son of man is
not immortal.
<br>[<b>31</b>] What is brighter than the sun? Yet its light fails. So
flesh and blood devise evil.
<br>[<b>32</b>] He marshals the host of the height of heaven; but all men
are dust and ashes.
<p>
<hr>
<h3>
Sir.18</h3>
[<b>1</b>] He who lives for ever created the whole universe;
<br>[<b>2</b>] the Lord alone will be declared righteous.
<br>[<b>4</b>] To none has he given power to proclaim his works; and who
can search out his mighty deeds?
<br>[<b>5</b>] Who can measure his majestic power? And who can fully recount
his mercies?
<br>[<b>6</b>] It is not possible to diminish or increase them, nor is
it possible to trace the wonders of the Lord.
<br>[<b>7</b>] When a man has finished, he is just beginning, and when
he stops, he will be at a loss.
<br>[<b>8</b>] What is man, and of what use is he? What is his good and
what is his evil?
<br>[<b>9</b>] The number of a man's days is great if he reaches a hundred
years.
<br>[<b>10</b>] Like a drop of water from the sea and a grain of sand so
are a few years in the day of eternity.
<br>[<b>11</b>] Therefore the Lord is patient with them and pours out his
mercy upon them.
<br>[<b>12</b>] He sees and recognizes that their end will be evil; therefore
he grants them forgiveness in abundance.
<br>[<b>13</b>] The compassion of man is for his neighbor, but the compassion
of the Lord is for all living beings. He rebukes and trains and teaches
them, and turns them back, as a shepherd his flock.
<br>[<b>14</b>] He has compassion on those who accept his discipline and
who are eager for his judgments.
<br>[<b>15</b>] My son, do not mix reproach with your good deeds, nor cause
grief by your words when you present a gift.
<br>[<b>16</b>] Does not the dew assuage the scorching heat? So a word
is better than a gift.
<br>[<b>17</b>] Indeed, does not a word surpass a good gift? Both are to
be found in a gracious man.
<br>[<b>18</b>] A fool is ungracious and abusive, and the gift of a grudging
man makes the eyes dim.
<br>[<b>19</b>] Before you speak, learn, and before you fall ill, take
care of your health.
<br>[<b>20</b>] Before judgment, examine yourself, and in the hour of visitation
you will find forgiveness.
<br>[<b>21</b>] Before falling ill, humble yourself, and when you are on
the point of sinning, turn back.
<br>[<b>22</b>] Let nothing hinder you from paying a vow promptly, and
do not wait until death to be released from it.
<br>[<b>23</b>] Before making a vow, prepare yourself; and do not be like
a man who tempts the Lord.
<br>[<b>24</b>] Think of his wrath on the day of death, and of the moment
of vengeance when he turns away his face.
<br>[<b>25</b>] In the time of plenty think of the time of hunger; in the
days of wealth think of poverty and need.
<br>[<b>26</b>] From morning to evening conditions change, and all things
move swiftly before the Lord.
<br>[<b>27</b>] A wise man is cautious in everything, and in days of sin
he guards against wrongdoing.
<br>[<b>28</b>] Every intelligent man knows wisdom, and he praises the
one who finds her.
<br>[<b>29</b>] Those who understand sayings become skilled themselves,
and pour forth apt proverbs.
<br>[<b>30</b>] Do not follow your base desires, but restrain your appetites.
<br>[<b>31</b>] If you allow your soul to take pleasure in base desire,
it will make you the laughingstock of your enemies.
<br>[<b>32</b>] Do not revel in great luxury, lest you become impoverished
by its expense.
<br>[<b>33</b>] Do not become a beggar by feasting with borrowed money,
when you have nothing in your purse.

Sir.19</h3>
[<b>1</b>] A workman who is a drunkard will not become rich; he who despises
small things will fail little by little.
<br>[<b>2</b>] Wine and women lead intelligent men astray, and the man
who consorts with harlots is very reckless.
<br>[<b>3</b>] Decay and worms will inherit him, and the reckless soul
will be snatched away.
<br>[<b>4</b>] One who trusts others too quickly is lightminded, and one
who sins does wrong to himself.
<br>[<b>5</b>] One who rejoices in wickedness will be condemned,
<br>[<b>6</b>] and for one who hates gossip evil is lessened.
<br>[<b>7</b>] Never repeat a conversation, and you will lose nothing at
all.
<br>[<b>8</b>] With friend or foe do not report it, and unless it would
be a sin for you, do not disclose it;
<br>[<b>9</b>] for some one has heard you and watched you, and when the
time comes he will hate you.
<br>[<b>10</b>] Have you heard a word? Let it die with you. Be brave! It
will not make you burst!
<br>[<b>11</b>] With such a word a fool will suffer pangs like a woman
in labor with a child.
<br>[<b>12</b>] Like an arrow stuck in the flesh of the thigh, so is a
word inside a fool.
<br>[<b>13</b>] Question a friend, perhaps he did not do it; but if he
did anything, so that he may do it no more.
<br>[<b>14</b>] Question a neighbor, perhaps he did not say it; but if
he said it, so that he may not say it again.
<br>[<b>15</b>] Question a friend, for often it is slander; so do not believe
everything you hear.
<br>[<b>16</b>] A person may make a slip without intending it. Who has
never
sinned with his tongue?
<br>[<b>17</b>] Question your neighbor before you threaten him; and let
the law of the Most High take its course.
<br>[<b>20</b>] All wisdom is the fear of the Lord, and in all wisdom there
is the fulfilment of the law.
<br>[<b>22</b>] But the knowledge of wickedness is not wisdom, nor is there
prudence where sinners take counsel.
<br>[<b>23</b>] There is a cleverness which is abominable, but there is
a fool who merely lacks wisdom.
<br>[<b>24</b>] Better is the God-fearing man who lacks intelligence, than
the highly prudent man who transgresses the law.
<br>[<b>25</b>] There is a cleverness which is scrupulous but unjust, and
there are people who distort kindness to gain a verdict.
<br>[<b>26</b>] There is a rascal bowed down in mourning, but inwardly
he is full of deceit.
<br>[<b>27</b>] He hides his face and pretends not to hear; but where no
one notices, he will forestall you.
<br>[<b>28</b>] And if by lack of strength he is prevented from sinning,
he will do evil when he finds an opportunity.
<br>[<b>29</b>] A man is known by his appearance, and a sensible man is
known by his face, when you meet him.
<br>[<b>30</b>] A man's attire and open-mouthed laughter, and a man's manner
of walking, show what he is.
<p>
<hr>
<h3>
Sir.20</h3>
[<b>1</b>] There is a reproof which is not timely; and there is a man who
keeps silent but is wise.
<br>[<b>2</b>] How much better it is to reprove than to stay angry! And
the one who confesses his fault will be kept from loss.
<br>[<b>4</b>] Like a eunuch's desire to violate a maiden is a man who
executes judgments by violence.
<br>[<b>5</b>] There is one who by keeping silent is found wise, while
another is detested for being too talkative.
<br>[<b>6</b>] There is one who keeps silent because he has no answer,
while another keeps silent because he knows when to speak.
<br>[<b>7</b>] A wise man will be silent until the right moment, but a
braggart and fool goes beyond the right moment.
<br>[<b>8</b>] Whoever uses too many words will be loathed, and whoever
usurps the right to speak will be hated.
<br>[<b>9</b>] There may be good fortune for a man in adversity, and a
windfall may result in a loss.
<br>[<b>10</b>] There is a gift that profits you nothing, and there is
a gift that brings a double return.
<br>[<b>11</b>] There are losses because of glory, and there are men who
have raised their heads from humble circumstances.
<br>[<b>12</b>] There is a man who buys much for a little, but pays for
it seven times over.
<br>[<b>13</b>] The wise man makes himself beloved through his words, but
the courtesies of fools are wasted.
<br>[<b>14</b>] A fool's gift will profit you nothing, for he has many
eyes instead of one.
<br>[<b>15</b>] He gives little and upbraids much, he opens his mouth like
a herald; today he lends and tomorrow he asks it back;
<br>such a one is a hateful man.
<br>[<b>16</b>] A fool will say, &quot;I have no friend, and there is no gratitude
for my good deeds; those who eat my bread speak unkindly.&quot;
<br>[<b>17</b>] How many will ridicule him, and how often!
<br>[<b>18</b>] A slip on the pavement is better than a slip of the tongue;
so the downfall of the wicked will occur speedily.
<br>[<b>19</b>] An ungracious man is like a story told at the wrong time,
which is continually on the lips of the ignorant.
<br>[<b>20</b>] A proverb from a fool's lips will be rejected, for he does
not tell it at its proper time.
<br>[<b>21</b>] A man may be prevented from sinning by his poverty, so
when he rests he feels no remorse.
<br>[<b>22</b>] A man may lose his life through shame, or lose it because
of his foolish look.
<br>[<b>23</b>] A man may for shame make promises to a friend, and needlessly
make him an enemy.
<br>[<b>24</b>] A lie is an ugly blot on a man; it is continually on the
lips of the ignorant.
<br>[<b>25</b>] A thief is preferable to a habitual liar, but the lot of
both is ruin.
<br>[<b>26</b>] The disposition of a liar brings disgrace, and his shame
is ever with him.
<br>[<b>27</b>] He who speaks wisely will advance himself, and a sensible
man will please great men.
<br>[<b>28</b>] Whoever cultivates the soil will heap up his harvest, and
whoever pleases great men will atone for injustice.
<br>[<b>29</b>] Presents and gifts blind the eyes of the wise; like a muzzle
on the mouth they avert reproofs.
<br>[<b>30</b>] Hidden wisdom and unseen treasure, what advantage is there
in either of them?
<br>[<b>31</b>] Better is the man who hides his folly than the man who
hides his wisdom.
<p>
<hr>
<h3>
Sir.21</h3>
[<b>1</b>] Have you sinned, my son? Do so no more, but pray about your
former sins.
<br>[<b>2</b>] Flee from sin as from a snake; for if you approach sin,
it will bite you. Its teeth are lion's teeth, and destroy the souls of
men.
<br>[<b>3</b>] All lawlessness is like a two-edged sword; there is no healing
for its wound.
<br>[<b>4</b>] Terror and violence will lay waste riches; thus the house
of the proud will be laid waste.
<br>[<b>5</b>] The prayer of a poor man goes from his lips to the ears
of God, and his judgment comes speedily.
<br>[<b>6</b>] Whoever hates reproof walks in the steps of the sinner,
but he that fears the Lord will repent in his heart.
<br>[<b>7</b>] He who is mighty in speech is known from afar; but the sensible
man, when he slips, is aware of it.
<br>[<b>8</b>] A man who builds his house with other people's money is
like one who gathers stones for his burial mound.
<br>[<b>9</b>] An assembly of the wicked is like tow gathered together,
and their end is a flame of fire.
<br>[<b>10</b>] The way of sinners is smoothly paved with stones, but at
its end is the pit of Hades.
<br>[<b>11</b>] Whoever keeps the law controls his thoughts, and wisdom
is the fulfilment of the fear of the Lord.
<br>[<b>12</b>] He who is not clever cannot be taught, but there is a cleverness
which increases bitterness.
<br>[<b>13</b>] The knowledge of a wise man will increase like a flood,
and his counsel like a flowing spring.
<br>[<b>14</b>] The mind of a fool is like a broken jar; it will hold no
knowledge.
<br>[<b>15</b>] When a man of understanding hears a wise saying, he will
praise it and add to it; when a reveler hears it, he dislikes it
<br>and casts it behind his back.
<br>[<b>16</b>] A fool's narration is like a burden on a journey, but delight
will be found in the speech of the intelligent.
<br>[<b>17</b>] The utterance of a sensible man will be sought in the assembly,
and they will ponder his words in their minds.
<br>[<b>18</b>] Like a house that has vanished, so is wisdom to a fool;
and the knowledge of the ignorant is unexamined talk.
<br>[<b>19</b>] To a senseless man education is fetters on his feet, and
like manacles on his right hand.
<br>[<b>20</b>] A fool raises his voice when he laughs, but a clever man
smiles quietly.
<br>[<b>21</b>] To a sensible man education is like a golden ornament,
and like a bracelet on the right arm.
<br>[<b>22</b>] The foot of a fool rushes into a house, but a man of experience
stands respectfully before it.
<br>[<b>23</b>] A boor peers into the house from the door, but a cultivated
man remains outside.
<br>[<b>24</b>] It is ill-mannered for a man to listen at a door, and a
discreet man is grieved by the disgrace.
<br>[<b>25</b>] The lips of strangers will speak of these things, but the
words of the prudent will be weighed in the balance.
<br>[<b>26</b>] The mind of fools is in their mouth, but the mouth of wise
men is in their mind.
<br>[<b>27</b>] When an ungodly man curses his adversary, he curses his
own soul.
<br>[<b>28</b>] A whisperer defiles his own soul and is hated in his neighborhood.
<p>
<hr>
<h3>
Sir.22</h3>
[<b>1</b>] The indolent may be compared to a filthy stone, and every one
hisses at his disgrace.
<br>[<b>2</b>] The indolent may be compared to the filth of dunghills;
any one that picks it up will shake it off his hand.
<br>[<b>3</b>] It is a disgrace to be the father of an undisciplined son,
and the birth of a daughter is a loss.
<br>[<b>4</b>] A sensible daughter obtains her husband, but one who acts
shamefully brings grief to her father.
<br>[<b>5</b>] An impudent daughter disgraces father and husband, and will
be despised by both.
<br>[<b>6</b>] Like music in mourning is a tale told at the wrong time,
but chastising and discipline are wisdom at all times.
<br>[<b>7</b>] He who teaches a fool is like one who glues potsherds together,
or who rouses a sleeper from deep slumber.
<br>[<b>8</b>] He who tells a story to a fool tells it to a drowsy man;
and at the end he will say, &quot;What is it?&quot;
<br>[<b>11</b>] Weep for the dead, for he lacks the light; and weep for
the fool, for he lacks intelligence; weep less bitterly for the dead, for
he has attained rest; but the life of the fool is worse than death.
<br>[<b>12</b>] Mourning for the dead lasts seven days, but for a fool
or an ungodly man it lasts all his life.
<br>[<b>13</b>] Do not talk much with a foolish man, and do not visit an
unintelligent man; guard yourself from him to escape trouble,
<br>and you will not be soiled when he shakes himself off; avoid him and
you will find rest, and you will never be wearied by his madness.
<br>[<b>14</b>] What is heavier than lead? And what is its name except
&quot;Fool&quot;?
<br>[<b>15</b>] Sand, salt, and a piece of iron are easier to bear than
a stupid man.
<br>[<b>16</b>] A wooden beam firmly bonded into a building will not be
torn loose by an earthquake; so the mind firmly fixed on a reasonable counsel
will not be afraid in a crisis.
<br>[<b>17</b>] A mind settled on an intelligent thought is like the stucco
decoration on the wall of a colonnade.
<br>[<b>18</b>] Fences set on a high place will not stand firm against
the wind; so a timid heart with a fool's purpose will not stand firm against
any fear.
<br>[<b>19</b>] A man who pricks an eye will make tears fall, and one who
pricks the heart makes it show feeling.
<br>[<b>20</b>] One who throws a stone at birds scares them away, and one
who reviles a friend will break off the friendship.
<br>[<b>21</b>] Even if you have drawn your sword against a friend, do
not despair, for a renewal of friendship is possible.
<br>[<b>22</b>] If you have opened your mouth against your friend, do not
worry, for reconciliation is possible; but as for reviling, arrogance,
disclosure of secrets, or a treacherous blow -- in these cases any friend
will flee.
<br>[<b>23</b>] Gain the trust of your neighbor in his poverty, that you
may rejoice with him in his prosperity; stand by him in time of affliction,
that you may share with him in his inheritance.
<br>[<b>24</b>] The vapor and smoke of the furnace precede the fire; so
insults precede bloodshed.
<br>[<b>25</b>] I will not be ashamed to protect a friend, and I will not
hide from him;
<br>[<b>26</b>] but if some harm should happen to me because of him, whoever
hears of it will beware of him.
<br>[<b>27</b>] O that a guard were set over my mouth, and a seal of prudence
upon my lips, that it may keep me from falling, so that my tongue may not
destroy me!
<p>
<hr>
<h3>
Sir.23</h3>
[<b>1</b>] O Lord, Father and Ruler of my life, do not abandon me to their
counsel, and let me not fall because of them!
<br>[<b>2</b>] O that whips were set over my thoughts, and the discipline
of wisdom over my mind! That they may not spare me in my errors, and that
it may not pass by my sins;
<br>[<b>3</b>] in order that my mistakes may not be multiplied, and my
sins may not abound; then I will not fall before my adversaries, and my
enemy will not rejoice over me.
<br>[<b>4</b>] O Lord, Father and God of my life, do not give me haughty
eyes,
<br>[<b>5</b>] and remove from me evil desire.
<br>[<b>6</b>] Let neither gluttony nor lust overcome me, and do not surrender
me to a shameless soul.
<br>[<b>7</b>] Listen, my children, to instruction concerning speech; the
one who observes it will never be caught.
<br>[<b>8</b>] The sinner is overtaken through his lips, the reviler and
the arrogant are tripped by them.
<br>[<b>9</b>] Do not accustom your mouth to oaths, and do not habitually
utter the name of the Holy One;
<br>[<b>10</b>] for as a servant who is continually examined under torture
will not lack bruises, so also the man who always swears and utters the
Name will not be cleansed from sin.
<br>[<b>11</b>] A man who swears many oaths will be filled with iniquity,
and the scourge will not leave his house; if he offends, his sin remains
on him, and if he disregards it, he sins doubly; if he has sworn needlessly,
he will not be justified, for his house will be filled with calamities.
<br>[<b>12</b>] There is an utterance which is comparable to death; may
it never be found in the inheritance of Jacob! For all these errors will
be far from the godly, and they will not wallow in sins.
<br>[<b>13</b>] Do not accustom your mouth to lewd vulgarity, for it involves
sinful speech.
<br>[<b>14</b>] Remember your father and mother when you sit among great
men; lest you be forgetful in their presence, and be deemed a fool on account
of your habits; then you will wish that you had never been born, and you
will curse the day of your birth.
<br>[<b>15</b>] A man accustomed to use insulting words will never become
disciplined all his days.
<br>[<b>16</b>] Two sorts of men multiply sins, and a third incurs wrath.
The soul heated like a burning fire will not be quenched until it is consumed;
a man who commits fornication with his near of kin will never cease until
the fire burns him up.
<br>[<b>17</b>] To a fornicator all bread tastes sweet; he will never cease
until he dies.
<br>[<b>18</b>] A man who breaks his marriage vows says to himself, &quot;Who
sees me? Darkness surrounds me, and the walls hide me, and no one sees
me. Why should I fear? The Most High will not take notice of my sins.&quot;
<br>[<b>19</b>] His fear is confined to the eyes of men, and he does not
realize that the eyes of the Lord are ten thousand times brighter than
the sun; they look upon all the ways of men, and perceive even the hidden
places.
<br>[<b>20</b>] Before the universe was created, it was known to him; so
it was also after it was finished.
<br>[<b>21</b>] This man will be punished in the streets of the city, and
where he least suspects it, he will be seized.
<br>[<b>22</b>] So it is with a woman who leaves her husband and provides
an heir by a stranger.
<br>[<b>23</b>] For first of all, she has disobeyed the law of the Most
High; second, she has committed an offense against her husband; and third,
she has committed adultery through harlotry and brought forth children
by another man.
<br>[<b>24</b>] She herself will be brought before the assembly, and punishment
will fall on her children.
<br>[<b>25</b>] Her children will not take root, and her branches will
not bear fruit.
<br>[<b>26</b>] She will leave her memory for a curse, and her disgrace
will not be blotted out.
<br>[<b>27</b>] Those who survive her will recognize that nothing is better
than the fear of the Lord, and nothing sweeter than to heed the commandments
of the Lord.
<p>
<hr>
<h3>
Sir.24</h3>
[<b>1</b>] Wisdom will praise herself, and will glory in the midst of her
people.
<br>[<b>2</b>] In the assembly of the Most High she will open her mouth,
and in the presence of his host she will glory:
<br>[<b>3</b>] &quot;I came forth from the mouth of the Most High, and covered
the earth like a mist.
<br>[<b>4</b>] I dwelt in high places, and my throne was in a pillar of
cloud.
<br>[<b>5</b>] Alone I have made the circuit of the vault of heaven and
have walked in the depths of the abyss.
<br>[<b>6</b>] In the waves of the sea, in the whole earth, and in every
people and nation I have gotten a possession.
<br>[<b>7</b>] Among all these I sought a resting place; I sought in whose
territory I might lodge.
<br>[<b>8</b>] &quot;Then the Creator of all things gave me a commandment, and
the one who created me assigned a place for my tent.
<br>And he said, `Make your dwelling in Jacob, and in Israel receive your
inheritance.'
<br>[<b>9</b>] From eternity, in the beginning, he created me, and for
eternity I shall not cease to exist.
<br>[<b>10</b>] In the holy tabernacle I ministered before him, and so
I was established in Zion.
<br>[<b>11</b>] In the beloved city likewise he gave me a resting place,
and in Jerusalem was my dominion.
<br>[<b>12</b>] So I took root in an honored people, in the portion of
the Lord, who is their inheritance.
<br>[<b>13</b>] &quot;I grew tall like a cedar in Lebanon, and like a cypress
on the heights of Hermon.
<br>[<b>14</b>] I grew tall like a palm tree in En-ge'di, and like rose
plants in Jericho; like a beautiful olive tree in the field, and like a
plane tree I grew tall.
<br>[<b>15</b>] Like cassia and camel's thorn I gave forth the aroma of
spices, and like choice myrrh I spread a pleasant odor, like galbanum,
onycha, and stacte, and like the fragrance of frankincense in the tabernacle.
<br>[<b>16</b>] Like a terebinth I spread out my branches, and my branches
are glorious and graceful.
<br>[<b>17</b>] Like a vine I caused loveliness to bud, and my blossoms
became glorious and abundant fruit.
<br>[<b>19</b>] &quot;Come to me, you who desire me, and eat your fill of my
produce.
<br>[<b>20</b>] For the remembrance of me is sweeter than honey, and my
inheritance sweeter than the honeycomb.
<br>[<b>21</b>] Those who eat me will hunger for more, and those who drink
me will thirst for more.
<br>[<b>22</b>] Whoever obeys me will not be put to shame, and those who
work with my help will not sin.&quot;
<br>[<b>23</b>] All this is the book of the covenant of the Most High God,
the law which Moses commanded us as an inheritance for the congregations
of Jacob.
<br>[<b>25</b>] It fills men with wisdom, like the Pishon, and like the
Tigris at the time of the first fruits.
<br>[<b>26</b>] It makes them full of understanding, like the Euphrates,
and like the Jordan at harvest time.
<br>[<b>27</b>] It makes instruction shine forth like light, like the Gihon
at the time of vintage.
<br>[<b>28</b>] Just as the first man did not know her perfectly, the last
one has not fathomed her;
<br>[<b>29</b>] for her thought is more abundant than the sea, and her
counsel deeper than the great abyss.
<br>[<b>30</b>] I went forth like a canal from a river and like a water
channel into a garden.
<br>[<b>31</b>] I said, &quot;I will water my orchard and drench my garden plot&quot;;
and lo, my canal became a river, and my river became a sea.
<br>[<b>32</b>] I will again make instruction shine forth like the dawn,
and I will make it shine afar;
<br>[<b>33</b>] I will again pour out teaching like prophecy, and leave
it to all future generations.
<br>[<b>34</b>] Observe that I have not labored for myself alone, but for
all who seek instruction.
<p>
<hr>
<h3>
Sir.25</h3>
[<b>1</b>] My soul takes pleasure in three things, and they are beautiful
in the sight of the Lord and of men; agreement between brothers, friendship
between neighbors, and a wife and a husband who live in harmony.
<br>[<b>2</b>] My soul hates three kinds of men, and I am greatly offended
at their life: a beggar who is proud, a rich man who is a liar, and an
adulterous old man who lacks good sense.
<br>[<b>3</b>] You have gathered nothing in your youth; how then can you
find anything in your old age?
<br>[<b>4</b>] What an attractive thing is judgment in gray-haired men,
and for the aged to possess good counsel!
<br>[<b>5</b>] How attractive is wisdom in the aged, and understanding
and counsel in honorable men!
<br>[<b>6</b>] Rich experience is the crown of the aged, and their boast
is the fear of the Lord.
<br>[<b>7</b>] With nine thoughts I have gladdened my heart, and a tenth
I shall tell with my tongue: a man rejoicing in his children;
<br>a man who lives to see the downfall of his foes;
<br>[<b>8</b>] happy is he who lives with an intelligent wife, and he who
has not made a slip with his tongue, and he who has not served a man inferior
to himself;
<br>[<b>9</b>] happy is he who has gained good sense, and he who speaks
to attentive listeners.
<br>[<b>10</b>] How great is he who has gained wisdom! But there is no
one superior to him who fears the Lord.
<br>[<b>11</b>] The fear of the Lord surpasses everything; to whom shall
be likened the one who holds it fast?
<br>[<b>13</b>] Any wound, but not a wound of the heart! Any wickedness,
but not the wickedness of a wife!
<br>[<b>14</b>] Any attack, but not an attack from those who hate! And
any vengeance, but not the vengeance of enemies!
<br>[<b>15</b>] There is no venom worse than a snake's venom, and no wrath
worse than an enemy's wrath.
<br>[<b>16</b>] I would rather dwell with a lion and a dragon than dwell
with an evil wife.
<br>[<b>17</b>] The wickedness of a wife changes her appearance, and darkens
her face like that of a bear.
<br>[<b>18</b>] Her husband takes his meals among the neighbors, and he
cannot help sighing bitterly.
<br>[<b>19</b>] Any iniquity is insignificant compared to a wife's iniquity;
may a sinner's lot befall her!
<br>[<b>20</b>] A sandy ascent for the feet of the aged -- such is a garrulous
wife for a quiet husband.
<br>[<b>21</b>] Do not be ensnared by a woman's beauty, and do not desire
a woman for her possessions.
<br>[<b>22</b>] There is wrath and impudence and great disgrace when a
wife supports her husband.
<br>[<b>23</b>] A dejected mind, a gloomy face, and a wounded heart are
caused by an evil wife. Drooping hands and weak knees
<br>are caused by the wife who does not make her husband happy.
<br>[<b>24</b>] From a woman sin had its beginning, and because of her
we all die.
<br>[<b>25</b>] Allow no outlet to water, and no boldness of speech in
an evil wife.
<br>[<b>26</b>] If she does not go as you direct, separate her from yourself.
<p>
<hr>
<h3>
Sir.26</h3>
[<b>1</b>] Happy is the husband of a good wife; the number of his days
will be doubled.
<br>[<b>2</b>] A loyal wife rejoices her husband, and he will complete
his years in peace.
<br>[<b>3</b>] A good wife is a great blessing; she will be granted among
the blessings of the man who fears the Lord.
<br>[<b>4</b>] Whether rich or poor, his heart is glad, and at all times
his face is cheerful.
<br>[<b>5</b>] Of three things my heart is afraid, and of a fourth I am
frightened: The slander of a city, the gathering of a mob, and false accusation
-- all these are worse than death.
<br>[<b>6</b>] There is grief of heart and sorrow when a wife is envious
of a rival, and a tongue-lashing makes it known to all.
<br>[<b>7</b>] An evil wife is an ox yoke which chafes; taking hold of
her is like grasping a scorpion.
<br>[<b>8</b>] There is great anger when a wife is drunken; she will not
hide her shame.
<br>[<b>9</b>] A wife's harlotry shows in her lustful eyes, and she is
known by her eyelids.
<br>[<b>10</b>] Keep strict watch over a headstrong daughter, lest, when
she finds liberty, she use it to her hurt.
<br>[<b>11</b>] Be on guard against her impudent eye, and do not wonder
if she sins against you.
<br>[<b>12</b>] As a thirsty wayfarer opens his mouth and drinks from any
water near him, so will she sit in front of every post and open her quiver
to the arrow.
<br>[<b>13</b>] A wife's charm delights her husband, and her skill puts
fat on his bones.
<br>[<b>14</b>] A silent wife is a gift of the Lord, and there is nothing
so precious as a disciplined soul.
<br>[<b>15</b>] A modest wife adds charm to charm, and no balance can weigh
the value of a chaste soul.
<br>[<b>16</b>] Like the sun rising in the heights of the Lord, so is the
beauty of a good wife in her well-ordered home.
<br>[<b>17</b>] Like the shining lamp on the holy lampstand, so is a beautiful
face on a stately figure.
<br>[<b>18</b>] Like pillars of gold on a base of silver, so are beautiful
feet with a steadfast heart.
<br>[<b>28</b>] At two things my heart is grieved, and because of a third
anger comes over me: a warrior in want through poverty,
<br>and intelligent men who are treated contemptuously; a man who turns
back from righteousness to sin -- the Lord will prepare him for the sword!
<br>[<b>29</b>] A merchant can hardly keep from wrongdoing, and a tradesman
will not be declared innocent of sin.
<p>
<hr>
<h3>
Sir.27</h3>
[<b>1</b>] Many have committed sin for a trifle, and whoever seeks to get
rich will avert his eyes.
<br>[<b>2</b>] As a stake is driven firmly into a fissure between stones,
so sin is wedged in between selling and buying.
<br>[<b>3</b>] If a man is not steadfast and zealous in the fear of the
Lord, his house will be quickly overthrown.
<br>[<b>4</b>] When a sieve is shaken, the refuse remains; so a man's filth
remains in his thoughts.
<br>[<b>5</b>] The kiln tests the potter's vessels; so the test of a man
is in his reasoning.
<br>[<b>6</b>] The fruit discloses the cultivation of a tree; so the expression
of a thought discloses the cultivation of a man's mind.
<br>[<b>7</b>] Do not praise a man before you hear him reason, for this
is the test of men.
<br>[<b>8</b>] If you pursue justice, you will attain it and wear it as
a glorious robe.
<br>[<b>9</b>] Birds flock with their kind; so truth returns to those who
practice it.
<br>[<b>10</b>] A lion lies in wait for prey; so does sin for the workers
of iniquity.
<br>[<b>11</b>] The talk of the godly man is always wise, but the fool
changes like the moon.
<br>[<b>12</b>] Among stupid people watch for a chance to leave, but among
thoughtful people stay on.
<br>[<b>13</b>] The talk of fools is offensive, and their laughter is wantonly
sinful.
<br>[<b>14</b>] The talk of men given to swearing makes one's hair stand
on end, and their quarrels make a man stop his ears.
<br>[<b>15</b>] The strife of the proud leads to bloodshed, and their abuse
is grievous to hear.
<br>[<b>16</b>] Whoever betrays secrets destroys confidence, and he will
never find a congenial friend.
<br>[<b>17</b>] Love your friend and keep faith with him; but if you betray
his secrets, do not run after him.
<br>[<b>18</b>] For as a man destroys his enemy, so you have destroyed
the friendship of your neighbor.
<br>[<b>19</b>] And as you allow a bird to escape from your hand, so you
have let your neighbor go, and will not catch him again.
<br>[<b>20</b>] Do not go after him, for he is too far off, and has escaped
like a gazelle from a snare.
<br>[<b>21</b>] For a wound may be bandaged, and there is reconciliation
after abuse, but whoever has betrayed secrets is without hope.
<br>[<b>22</b>] Whoever winks his eye plans evil deeds, and no one can
keep him from them.
<br>[<b>23</b>] In your presence his mouth is all sweetness, and he admires
your words; but later he will twist his speech and with your own words
he will give offense.
<br>[<b>24</b>] I have hated many things, but none to be compared to him;
even the Lord will hate him.
<br>[<b>25</b>] Whoever throws a stone straight up throws it on his own
head; and a treacherous blow opens up wounds.
<br>[<b>26</b>] He who digs a pit will fall into it, and he who sets a
snare will be caught in it.
<br>[<b>27</b>] If a man does evil, it will roll back upon him, and he
will not know where it came from.
<br>[<b>28</b>] Mockery and abuse issue from the proud man, but vengeance
lies in wait for him like a lion.
<br>[<b>29</b>] Those who rejoice in the fall of the godly will be caught
in a snare, and pain will consume them before their death.
<br>[<b>30</b>] Anger and wrath, these also are abominations, and the sinful
man will possess them.
<p>
<hr>
<h3>
Sir.28</h3>
[<b>1</b>] He that takes vengeance will suffer vengeance from the Lord,
and he will firmly establish his sins.
<br>[<b>2</b>] Forgive your neighbor the wrong he has done, and then your
sins will be pardoned when you pray.
<br>[<b>3</b>] Does a man harbor anger against another, and yet seek for
healing from the Lord?
<br>[<b>4</b>] Does he have no mercy toward a man like himself, and yet
pray for his own sins?
<br>[<b>5</b>] If he himself, being flesh, maintains wrath, who will make
expiation for his sins?
<br>[<b>6</b>] Remember the end of your life, and cease from enmity, remember
destruction and death, and be true to the commandments.
<br>[<b>7</b>] Remember the commandments, and do not be angry with your
neighbor; remember the covenant of the Most High, and overlook ignorance.
<br>[<b>8</b>] Refrain from strife, and you will lessen sins; for a man
given to anger will kindle strife,
<br>[<b>9</b>] and a sinful man will disturb friends and inject enmity
among those who are at peace.
<br>[<b>10</b>] In proportion to the fuel for the fire, so will be the
burning, and in proportion to the obstinacy of strife will be the burning;
in proportion to the strength of the man will be his anger, and in proportion
to his wealth he will heighten his wrath.
<br>[<b>11</b>] A hasty quarrel kindles fire, and urgent strife sheds blood.
<br>[<b>12</b>] If you blow on a spark, it will glow; if you spit on it,
it will be put out; and both come out of your mouth.
<br>[<b>13</b>] Curse the whisperer and deceiver, for he has destroyed
many who were at peace.
<br>[<b>14</b>] Slander has shaken many, and scattered them from nation
to nation, and destroyed strong cities, and overturned the houses of great
men.
<br>[<b>15</b>] Slander has driven away courageous women, and deprived
them of the fruit of their toil.
<br>[<b>16</b>] Whoever pays heed to slander will not find rest, nor will
he settle down in peace.
<br>[<b>17</b>] The blow of a whip raises a welt, but a blow of the tongue
crushes the bones.
<br>[<b>18</b>] Many have fallen by the edge of the sword, but not so many
as have fallen because of the tongue.
<br>[<b>19</b>] Happy is the man who is protected from it, who has not
been exposed to its anger, who has not borne its yoke,
<br>and has not been bound with its fetters;
<br>[<b>20</b>] for its yoke is a yoke of iron, and its fetters are fetters
of bronze;
<br>[<b>21</b>] its death is an evil death, and Hades is preferable to
it.
<br>[<b>22</b>] It will not be master over the godly, and they will not
be burned in its flame.
<br>[<b>23</b>] Those who forsake the Lord will fall into its power; it
will burn among them and will not be put out. It will be sent out against
them like a lion; like a leopard it will mangle them.
<br>[<b>24</b>] See that you fence in your property with thorns, lock up
your silver and gold,
<br>[<b>25</b>] make balances and scales for your words, and make a door
and a bolt for your mouth.
<br>[<b>26</b>] Beware lest you err with your tongue, lest you fall before
him who lies in wait.
<p>
<hr>
<h3>
Sir.29</h3>
[<b>1</b>] He that shows mercy will lend to his neighbor, and he that strengthens
him with his hand keeps the commandments.
<br>[<b>2</b>] Lend to your neighbor in the time of his need; and in turn,
repay your neighbor promptly.
<br>[<b>3</b>] Confirm your word and keep faith with him, and on every
occasion you will find what you need.
<br>[<b>4</b>] Many persons regard a loan as a windfall, and cause trouble
to those who help them.
<br>[<b>5</b>] A man will kiss another's hands until he gets a loan, and
will lower his voice in speaking of his neighbor's money;
<br>but at the time for repayment he will delay, and will pay in words
of unconcern, and will find fault with the time.
<br>[<b>6</b>] If the lender exert pressure, he will hardly get back half,
and will regard that as a windfall. If he does not, the borrower has robbed
him of his money, and he has needlessly made him his enemy; he will repay
him with curses and reproaches,
<br>and instead of glory will repay him with dishonor.
<br>[<b>7</b>] Because of such wickedness, therefore, many have refused
to lend; they have been afraid of being defrauded needlessly.
<br>[<b>8</b>] Nevertheless, be patient with a man in humble circumstances,
and do not make him wait for your alms.
<br>[<b>9</b>] Help a poor man for the commandment's sake, and because
of his need do not send him away empty.
<br>[<b>10</b>] Lose your silver for the sake of a brother or a friend,
and do not let it rust under a stone and be lost.
<br>[<b>11</b>] Lay up your treasure according to the commandments of the
Most High, and it will profit you more than gold.
<br>[<b>12</b>] Store up almsgiving in your treasury, and it will rescue
you from all affliction;
<br>[<b>13</b>] more than a mighty shield and more than a heavy spear,
it will fight on your behalf against your enemy.
<br>[<b>14</b>] A good man will be surety for his neighbor, but a man who
has lost his sense of shame will fail him.
<br>[<b>15</b>] Do not forget all the kindness of your surety, for he has
given his life for you.
<br>[<b>16</b>] A sinner will overthrow the prosperity of his surety,
<br>[<b>17</b>] and one who does not feel grateful will abandon his rescuer.
<br>[<b>18</b>] Being surety has ruined many men who were prosperous, and
has shaken them like a wave of the sea; it has driven men of power into
exile, and they have wandered among foreign nations.
<br>[<b>19</b>] The sinner who has fallen into suretyship and pursues gain
will fall into lawsuits.
<br>[<b>20</b>] Assist your neighbor according to your ability, but take
heed to yourself lest you fall.
<br>[<b>21</b>] The essentials for life are water and bread and clothing
and a house to cover one's nakedness.
<br>[<b>22</b>] Better is the life of a poor man under the shelter of his
roof than sumptuous food in another man's house.
<br>[<b>23</b>] Be content with little or much.
<br>[<b>24</b>] It is a miserable life to go from house to house, and where
you are a stranger you may not open your mouth;
<br>[<b>25</b>] you will play the host and provide drink without being
thanked, and besides this you will hear bitter words:
<br>[<b>26</b>] &quot;Come here, stranger, prepare the table, and if you have
anything at hand, let me have it to eat.&quot;
<br>[<b>27</b>] &quot;Give place, stranger, to an honored person; my brother
has come to stay with me; I need my house.&quot;
<br>[<b>28</b>] These things are hard to bear for a man who has feeling:
scolding about lodging and the reproach of the moneylender.
<p>
<hr>
<h3>
Sir.30</h3>
[<b>1</b>] He who loves his son will whip him often, in order that he may
rejoice at the way he turns out.
<br>[<b>2</b>] He who disciplines his son will profit by him, and will
boast of him among acquaintances.
<br>[<b>3</b>] He who teaches his son will make his enemies envious, and
will glory in him in the presence of friends.
<br>[<b>4</b>] The father may die, and yet he is not dead, for he has left
behind him one like himself;
<br>[<b>5</b>] while alive he saw and rejoiced, and when he died he was
not grieved;
<br>[<b>6</b>] he has left behind him an avenger against his enemies, and
one to repay the kindness of his friends.
<br>[<b>7</b>] He who spoils his son will bind up his wounds, and his feelings
will be troubled at every cry.
<br>[<b>8</b>] A horse that is untamed turns out to be stubborn, and a
son unrestrained turns out to be wilful.
<br>[<b>9</b>] Pamper a child, and he will frighten you; play with him,
and he will give you grief.
<br>[<b>10</b>] Do not laugh with him, lest you have sorrow with him, and
in the end you will gnash your teeth.
<br>[<b>11</b>] Give him no authority in his youth, and do not ignore his
errors.
<br>[<b>12</b>] Bow down his neck in his youth, and beat his sides while
he is young, lest he become stubborn and disobey you,
<br>and you have sorrow of soul from him.
<br>[<b>13</b>] Discipline your son and take pains with him, that you may
not be offended by his shamelessness.
<br>[<b>14</b>] Better off is a poor man who is well and strong in constitution
than a rich man who is severely afflicted in body.
<br>[<b>15</b>] Health and soundness are better than all gold, and a robust
body than countless riches.
<br>[<b>16</b>] There is no wealth better than health of body, and there
is no gladness above joy of heart.
<br>[<b>17</b>] Death is better than a miserable life, and eternal rest
than chronic sickness.
<br>[<b>18</b>] Good things poured out upon a mouth that is closed are
like offerings of food placed upon a grave.
<br>[<b>19</b>] Of what use to an idol is an offering of fruit? For it
can neither eat nor smell. So is he who is afflicted by the Lord;
<br>[<b>20</b>] he sees with his eyes and groans, like a eunuch who embraces
a maiden and groans.
<br>[<b>21</b>] Do not give yourself over to sorrow, and do not afflict
yourself deliberately.
<br>[<b>22</b>] Gladness of heart is the life of man, and the rejoicing
of a man is length of days.
<br>[<b>23</b>] Delight your soul and comfort your heart, and remove sorrow
far from you, for sorrow has destroyed many, and there is no profit in
it.
<br>[<b>24</b>] Jealousy and anger shorten life, and anxiety brings on
old age too soon.
<br>[<b>25</b>] A man of cheerful and good heart will give heed to the
food he eats.
<p>
<hr>
<h3>
Sir.31</h3>
[<b>1</b>] Wakefulness over wealth wastes away one's flesh, and anxiety
about it removes sleep.
<br>[<b>2</b>] Wakeful anxiety prevents slumber, and a severe illness carries
off sleep.
<br>[<b>3</b>] The rich man toils as his wealth accumulates, and when he
rests he fills himself with his dainties.
<br>[<b>4</b>] The poor man toils as his livelihood diminishes, and when
he rests he becomes needy.
<br>[<b>5</b>] He who loves gold will not be justified, and he who pursues
money will be led astray by it.
<br>[<b>6</b>] Many have come to ruin because of gold, and their destruction
has met them face to face.
<br>[<b>7</b>] It is a stumbling block to those who are devoted to it,
and every fool will be taken captive by it.
<br>[<b>8</b>] Blessed is the rich man who is found blameless, and who
does not go after gold.
<br>[<b>9</b>] Who is he? And we will call him blessed, for he has done
wonderful things among his people.
<br>[<b>10</b>] Who has been tested by it and been found perfect? Let it
be for him a ground for boasting. Who has had the power to transgress and
did not transgress, and to do evil and did not do it?
<br>[<b>11</b>] His prosperity will be established, and the assembly will
relate his acts of charity.
<br>[<b>12</b>] Are you seated at the table of a great man? Do not be greedy
at it, and do not say, &quot;There is certainly much upon it!&quot;
<br>[<b>13</b>] Remember that a greedy eye is a bad thing. What has been
created more greedy than the eye? Therefore it sheds tears from every face.
<br>[<b>14</b>] Do not reach out your hand for everything you see, and
do not crowd your neighbor at the dish.
<br>[<b>15</b>] Judge your neighbor's feelings by your own, and in every
matter be thoughtful.
<br>[<b>16</b>] Eat like a human being what is set before you, and do not
chew greedily, lest you be hated.
<br>[<b>17</b>] Be the first to stop eating, for the sake of good manners,
and do not be insatiable, lest you give offense.
<br>[<b>18</b>] If you are seated among many persons, do not reach out
your hand before they do.
<br>[<b>19</b>] How ample a little is for a well-disciplined man! He does
not breathe heavily upon his bed.
<br>[<b>20</b>] Healthy sleep depends on moderate eating; he rises early,
and feels fit. The distress of sleeplessness and of nausea
<br>and colic are with the glutton.
<br>[<b>21</b>] If you are overstuffed with food, get up in the middle
of the meal, and you will have relief.
<br>[<b>22</b>] Listen to me, my son, and do not disregard me, and in the
end you will appreciate my words. In all your work be industrious, and
no sickness will overtake you.
<br>[<b>23</b>] Men will praise the one who is liberal with food, and their
testimony to his excellence is trustworthy.
<br>[<b>24</b>] The city will complain of the one who is niggardly with
food, and their testimony to his niggardliness is accurate.
<br>[<b>25</b>] Do not aim to be valiant over wine, for wine has destroyed
many.
<br>[<b>26</b>] Fire and water prove the temper of steel, so wine tests
hearts in the strife of the proud.
<br>[<b>27</b>] Wine is like life to men, if you drink it in moderation.
What is life to a man who is without wine? It has been created to make
men glad.
<br>[<b>28</b>] Wine drunk in season and temperately is rejoicing of heart
and gladness of soul.
<br>[<b>29</b>] Wine drunk to excess is bitterness of soul, with provocation
and stumbling.
<br>[<b>30</b>] Drunkenness increases the anger of a fool to his injury,
reducing his strength and adding wounds.
<br>[<b>31</b>] Do not reprove your neighbor at a banquet of wine, and
do not despise him in his merrymaking; speak no word of reproach to him,
and do not afflict him by making demands of him.
<p>
<hr>
<h3>
Sir.32</h3>
[<b>1</b>] If they make you master of the feast, do not exalt yourself;
be among them as one of them; take good care of them and then be seated;
<br>[<b>2</b>] when you have fulfilled your duties, take your place, that
you may be merry on their account and receive a wreath for your excellent
leadership.
<br>[<b>3</b>] Speak, you who are older, for it is fitting that you should,
but with accurate knowledge, and do not interrupt the music.
<br>[<b>4</b>] Where there is entertainment, do not pour out talk; do not
display your cleverness out of season.
<br>[<b>5</b>] A ruby seal in a setting of gold is a concert of music at
a banquet of wine.
<br>[<b>6</b>] A seal of emerald in a rich setting of gold is the melody
of music with good wine.
<br>[<b>7</b>] Speak, young man, if there is need of you, but no more than
twice, and only if asked.
<br>[<b>8</b>] Speak concisely, say much in few words; be as one who knows
and yet holds his tongue.
<br>[<b>9</b>] Among the great do not act as their equal; and when another
is speaking, do not babble.
<br>[<b>10</b>] Lightning speeds before the thunder, and approval precedes
a modest man.
<br>[<b>11</b>] Leave in good time and do not be the last; go home quickly
and do not linger.
<br>[<b>12</b>] Amuse yourself there, and do what you have in mind, but
do not sin through proud speech.
<br>[<b>13</b>] And for these things bless him who made you and satisfies
you with his good gifts.
<br>[<b>14</b>] He who fears the Lord will accept his discipline, and those
who rise early to seek him will find favor.
<br>[<b>15</b>] He who seeks the law will be filled with it, but the hypocrite
will stumble at it.
<br>[<b>16</b>] Those who fear the Lord will form true judgments, and like
a light they will kindle righteous deeds.
<br>[<b>17</b>] A sinful man will shun reproof, and will find a decision
according to his liking.
<br>[<b>18</b>] A man of judgment will not overlook an idea, and an insolent
and proud man will not cower in fear.
<br>[<b>19</b>] Do nothing without deliberation; and when you have acted,
do not regret it.
<br>[<b>20</b>] Do not go on a path full of hazards, and do not stumble
over stony ground.
<br>[<b>21</b>] Do not be overconfident on a smooth way,
<br>[<b>22</b>] and give good heed to your paths.
<br>[<b>23</b>] Guard yourself in every act, for this is the keeping of
the commandments.
<br>[<b>24</b>] He who believes the law gives heed to the commandments,
and he who trusts the Lord will not suffer loss.
<p>
<hr>
<h3>
Sir.33</h3>
[<b>1</b>] No evil will befall the man who fears the Lord, but in trial
he will deliver him again and again.
<br>[<b>2</b>] A wise man will not hate the law, but he who is hypocritical
about it is like a boat in a storm.
<br>[<b>3</b>] A man of understanding will trust in the law; for him the
law is as dependable as an inquiry by means of Urim.
<br>[<b>4</b>] Prepare what to say, and thus you will be heard; bind together
your instruction, and make your answer.
<br>[<b>5</b>] The heart of a fool is like a cart wheel, and his thoughts
like a turning axle.
<br>[<b>6</b>] A stallion is like a mocking friend; he neighs under every
one who sits on him.
<br>[<b>7</b>] Why is any day better than another, when all the daylight
in the year is from the sun?
<br>[<b>8</b>] By the Lord's decision they were distinguished, and he appointed
the different seasons and feasts;
<br>[<b>9</b>] some of them he exalted and hallowed, and some of them he
made ordinary days.
<br>[<b>10</b>] All men are from the ground, and Adam was created of the
dust.
<br>[<b>11</b>] In the fullness of his knowledge the Lord distinguished
them and appointed their different ways;
<br>[<b>12</b>] some of them he blessed and exalted, and some of them he
made holy and brought near to himself; but some of them he cursed and brought
low, and he turned them out of their place.
<br>[<b>13</b>] As clay in the hand of the potter -- for all his ways are
as he pleases -- so men are in the hand of him who made them, to give them
as he decides.
<br>[<b>14</b>] Good is the opposite of evil, and life the opposite of
death; so the sinner is the opposite of the godly.
<br>[<b>15</b>] Look upon all the works of the Most High; they likewise
are in pairs, one the opposite of the other.
<br>[<b>16</b>] I was the last on watch; I was like one who gleans after
the grape-gatherers; by the blessing of the Lord I excelled,
<br>and like a grape-gatherer I filled my wine press.
<br>[<b>17</b>] Consider that I have not labored for myself alone, but
for all who seek instruction.
<br>[<b>18</b>] Hear me, you who are great among the people, and you leaders
of the congregation, hearken.
<br>[<b>19</b>] To son or wife, to brother or friend, do not give power
over yourself, as long as you live; and do not give your property to another,
lest you change your mind and must ask for it.
<br>[<b>20</b>] While you are still alive and have breath in you, do not
let any one take your place.
<br>[<b>21</b>] For it is better that your children should ask from you
than that you should look to the hand of you sons.
<br>[<b>22</b>] Excel in all that you do; bring no stain upon your honor.
<br>[<b>23</b>] At the time when you end the days of your life, in the
hour of death, distribute your inheritance.
<br>[<b>24</b>] Fodder and a stick and burdens for an ass; bread and discipline
and work for a servant.
<br>[<b>25</b>] Set your slave to work, and you will find rest; leave his
hands idle, and he will seek liberty.
<br>[<b>26</b>] Yoke and thong will bow the neck, and for a wicked servant
there are racks and tortures.
<br>[<b>27</b>] Put him to work, that he may not be idle, for idleness
teaches much evil.
<br>[<b>28</b>] Set him to work, as is fitting for him, and if he does
not obey, make his fetters heavy.

<br>[<b>29</b>] Do not act immoderately toward anybody, and do nothing
without discretion.
<br>[<b>30</b>] If you have a servant, let him be as yourself, because
you have bought him with blood.
<br>[<b>31</b>] If you have a servant, treat him as a brother, for as your
own soul you will need him. If you ill-treat him, and he leaves and runs
away, which way will you go to seek him?
<p>
<hr>
<h3>
Sir.34</h3>
[<b>1</b>] A man of no understanding has vain and false hopes, and dreams
give wings to fools.
<br>[<b>2</b>] As one who catches at a shadow and pursues the wind, so
is he who gives heed to dreams.
<br>[<b>3</b>] The vision of dreams is this against that, the likeness
of a face confronting a face.
<br>[<b>4</b>] From an unclean thing what will be made clean? And from
something false what will be true?
<br>[<b>5</b>] Divinations and omens and dreams are folly, and like a woman
in travail the mind has fancies.
<br>[<b>6</b>] Unless they are sent from the Most High as a visitation,
do not give your mind to them.
<br>[<b>7</b>] For dreams have deceived many, and those who put their hope
in them have failed.
<br>[<b>8</b>] Without such deceptions the law will be fulfilled, and wisdom
is made perfect in truthful lips.
<br>[<b>9</b>] An educated man knows many things, and one with much experience
will speak with understanding.
<br>[<b>10</b>] He that is inexperienced knows few things, but he that
has traveled acquires much cleverness.
<br>[<b>11</b>] I have seen many things in my travels, and I understand
more than I can express.
<br>[<b>12</b>] I have often been in danger of death, but have escaped
because of these experiences.
<br>[<b>13</b>] The spirit of those who fear the Lord will live, for their
hope is in him who saves them.
<br>[<b>14</b>] He who fears the Lord will not be timid, nor play the coward,
for he is his hope.
<br>[<b>15</b>] Blessed is the soul of the man who fears the Lord! To whom
does he look? And who is his support?
<br>[<b>16</b>] The eyes of the Lord are upon those who love him, a mighty
protection and strong support, a shelter from the hot wind and a shade
from noonday sun, a guard against stumbling and a defense against falling.
<br>[<b>17</b>] He lifts up the soul and gives light to the eyes; he grants
healing, life, and blessing.
<br>[<b>18</b>] If one sacrifices from what has been wrongfully obtained,
the offering is blemished; the gifts of the lawless are not acceptable.
<br>[<b>19</b>] The Most High is not pleased with the offerings of the
ungodly; and he is not propitiated for sins by a multitude of sacrifices.
<br>[<b>20</b>] Like one who kills a son before his father's eyes is the
man who offers a sacrifice from the property of the poor.
<br>[<b>21</b>] The bread of the needy is the life of the poor; whoever
deprives them of it is a man of blood.
<br>[<b>22</b>] To take away a neighbor's living is to murder him; to deprive
an employee of his wages is to shed blood.
<br>[<b>23</b>] When one builds and another tears down, what do they gain
but toil?
<br>[<b>24</b>] When one prays and another curses, to whose voice will
the Lord listen?
<br>[<b>25</b>] If a man washes after touching a dead body, and touches
it again, what has he gained by his washing?
<br>[<b>26</b>] So if a man fasts for his sins, and goes again and does
the same things, who will listen to his prayer? And what has he gained
by humbling himself?

Sir.35</h3>
[<b>1</b>] He who keeps the law makes many offerings; he who heeds the
commandments sacrifices a peace offering.
<br>[<b>2</b>] He who returns a kindness offers fine flour, and he who
gives alms sacrifices a thank offering.
<br>[<b>3</b>] To keep from wickedness is pleasing to the Lord, and to
forsake unrighteousness is atonement.
<br>[<b>4</b>] Do not appear before the Lord empty-handed,
<br>[<b>5</b>] for all these things are to be done because of the commandment.
<br>[<b>6</b>] The offering of a righteous man anoints the altar, and its
pleasing odor rises before the Most High.
<br>[<b>7</b>] The sacrifice of a righteous man is acceptable, and the
memory of it will not be forgotten.
<br>[<b>8</b>] Glorify the Lord generously, and do not stint the first
fruits of your hands.
<br>[<b>9</b>] With every gift show a cheerful face, and dedicate your
tithe with gladness.
<br>[<b>10</b>] Give to the Most High as he has given, and as generously
as your hand has found.
<br>[<b>11</b>] For the Lord is the one who repays, and he will repay you
sevenfold.
<br>[<b>12</b>] Do not offer him a bribe, for he will not accept it; and
do not trust to an unrighteous sacrifice; for the Lord is the judge, and
with him is no partiality.
<br>[<b>13</b>] He will not show partiality in the case of a poor man;
and he will listen to the prayer of one who is wronged.
<br>[<b>14</b>] He will not ignore the supplication of the fatherless,
nor the widow when she pours out her story.
<br>[<b>15</b>] Do not the tears of the widow run down her cheek as she
cries out against him who has caused them to fall?
<br>[<b>16</b>] He whose service is pleasing to the Lord will be accepted,
and his prayer will reach to the clouds.
<br>[<b>17</b>] The prayer of the humble pierces the clouds, and he will
not be consoled until it reaches the Lord; he will not desist until the
Most High visits him, and does justice for the righteous, and executes
judgment.
<br>[<b>18</b>] And the Lord will not delay, neither will he be patient
with them, till he crushes the loins of the unmerciful and repays vengeance
on the nations; till he takes away the multitude of the insolent, and breaks
the scepters of the unrighteous;
<br>[<b>19</b>] till he repays the man according to his deeds, and the
works of men according to their devices; till he judges the case of his
people and makes them rejoice in his mercy.
<br>[<b>20</b>] Mercy is as welcome when he afflicts them as clouds of
rain in the time of drought.

[<b>1</b>] Have mercy upon us, O Lord, the God of all, and look upon us,

thy might.
<br>[<b>4</b>] As in us thou hast been sanctified before them, so in them
be thou magnified before us;
<br>[<b>5</b>] and let them know thee, as we have known that there is not
God but thee, O Lord.
<br>[<b>6</b>] Show signs anew, and work further wonders; make thy hand
and thy right arm glorious.
<br>[<b>7</b>] Rouse thy anger and pour out thy wrath; destroy the adversary
and wipe out the enemy.
<br>[<b>8</b>] Hasten the day, and remember the appointed time, and let
people recount thy mighty deeds.
<br>[<b>9</b>] Let him who survives be consumed in the fiery wrath, and
may those who harm thy people meet destruction.
<br>[<b>10</b>] Crush the heads of the rulers of the enemy, who say, &quot;There
is no one but ourselves.&quot;
<br>[<b>11</b>] Gather all the tribes of Jacob, and give them their inheritance,
as at the beginning.
<br>[<b>12</b>] Have mercy, O Lord, upon the people called by thy name,
upon Israel, whom thou hast likened to a first-born son.
<br>[<b>13</b>] Have pity on the city of thy sanctuary, Jerusalem, the
place of thy rest.
<br>[<b>14</b>] Fill Zion with the celebration of thy wondrous deeds, and
thy temple with thy glory.
<br>[<b>15</b>] Bear witness to those whom thou didst create in the beginning,
and fulfil the prophecies spoken in thy name.
<br>[<b>16</b>] Reward those who wait for thee, and let thy prophets be
found trustworthy.
<br>[<b>17</b>] Hearken, O Lord, to the prayer of thy servants, according
to the blessing of Aaron for thy people, and all who are on the earth will
know that thou art the Lord, the God of the ages.
<br>[<b>18</b>] The stomach will take any food, yet one food is better
than another.
<br>[<b>19</b>] As the palate tastes the kinds of game, so an intelligent
mind detects false words.
<br>[<b>20</b>] A perverse mind will cause grief, but a man of experience
will pay him back.
<br>[<b>21</b>] A woman will accept any man, but one daughter is better
than another.
<br>[<b>22</b>] A woman's beauty gladdens the countenance, and surpasses
every human desire.
<br>[<b>23</b>] If kindness and humility mark her speech, her husband is
not like other men.
<br>[<b>24</b>] He who acquires a wife gets his best possession, a helper
fit for him and a pillar of support.
<br>[<b>25</b>] Where there is no fence, the property will be plundered;
and where there is no wife, a man will wander about and sigh.
<br>[<b>26</b>] For who will trust a nimble robber that skips from city
to city? So who will trust a man that has no home,
<br>and lodges wherever night finds him?

<h3>
Sir.37</h3>
[<b>1</b>] Every friend will say, &quot;I too am a friend&quot;; but some friends
are friends only in name.
<br>[<b>2</b>] Is it not a grief to the death when a companion and friend
turns to enmity?
<br>[<b>3</b>] O evil imagination, why were you formed to cover the land
with deceit?
<br>[<b>4</b>] Some companions rejoice in the happiness of a friend, but
in time of trouble are against him.
<br>[<b>5</b>] Some companions help a friend for their stomach's sake,
and in the face of battle take up the shield.
<br>[<b>6</b>] Do not forget a friend in your heart, and be not unmindful
of him in your wealth.
<br>[<b>7</b>] Every counselor praises counsel, but some give counsel in
their own interest.
<br>[<b>8</b>] Be wary of a counselor, and learn first what is his interest
-- for he will take thought for himself -- lest he cast the lot against
you
<br>[<b>9</b>] and tell you, &quot;Your way is good,&quot; and then stand aloof to
see what will happen to you.
<br>[<b>10</b>] Do not consult the one who looks at you suspiciously; hide
your counsel from those who are jealous of you.
<br>[<b>11</b>] Do not consult with a woman about her rival or with a coward
about war, with a merchant about barter or with a buyer about selling,
with a grudging man about gratitude or with a merciless man about kindness,
with an idler about any work or with a man hired for a year about completing
his work, with a lazy servant about a big task -- pay no attention to these
in any matter of counsel.
<br>[<b>12</b>] But stay constantly with a godly man whom you know to be
a keeper of the commandments, whose soul is in accord with your soul, and
who will sorrow with you if you fail.
<br>[<b>13</b>] And establish the counsel of your own heart, for no one
is more faithful to you than it is.
<br>[<b>14</b>] For a man's soul sometimes keeps him better informed than
seven watchmen sitting high on a watchtower.
<br>[<b>15</b>] And besides all this pray to the Most High that he may
direct your way in truth.
<br>[<b>16</b>] Reason is the beginning of every work, and counsel precedes
every undertaking.
<br>[<b>17</b>] As a clue to changes of heart
<br>[<b>18</b>] four turns of fortune appear, good and evil, life and death;
and it is the tongue that continually rules them.
<br>[<b>19</b>] A man may be shrewd and the teacher of many, and yet be
unprofitable to himself.
<br>[<b>20</b>] A man skilled in words may be hated; he will be destitute
of all food,
<br>[<b>21</b>] for grace was not given him by the Lord, since he is lacking
in all wisdom.
<br>[<b>22</b>] A man may be wise to his own advantage, and the fruits
of his understanding may be trustworthy on his lips.
<br>[<b>23</b>] A wise man will instruct his own people, and the fruits
of his understanding will be trustworthy.
<br>[<b>24</b>] A wise man will have praise heaped upon him, and all who
see him will call him happy.
<br>[<b>25</b>] The life of a man is numbered by days, but the days of
Israel are without number.
<br>[<b>26</b>] He who is wise among his people will inherit confidence,
and his name will live for ever.
<br>[<b>27</b>] My son, test your soul while you live; see what is bad
for it and do not give it that.
<br>[<b>28</b>] For not everything is good for every one, and not every
person enjoys everything.
<br>[<b>29</b>] Do not have an insatiable appetite for any luxury, and
do not give yourself up to food;
<br>[<b>30</b>] for overeating brings sickness, and gluttony leads to nausea.
<br>[<b>31</b>] Many have died of gluttony, but he who is careful to avoid
it prolongs his life.

Sir.38</h3>
[<b>1</b>] Honor the physician with the honor due him, according to your
need of him, for the Lord created him;
<br>[<b>2</b>] for healing comes from the Most High, and he will receive
a gift from the king.
<br>[<b>3</b>] The skill of the physician lifts up his head, and in the
presence of great men he is admired.
<br>[<b>4</b>] The Lord created medicines from the earth, and a sensible
man will not despise them.
<br>[<b>5</b>] Was not water made sweet with a tree in order that his power
might be known?
<br>[<b>6</b>] And he gave skill to men that he might be glorified in his
marvelous works.
<br>[<b>7</b>] By them he heals and takes away pain;
<br>[<b>8</b>] the pharmacist makes of them a compound. His works will
never be finished; and from him health is upon the face of the earth.
<br>[<b>9</b>] My son, when you are sick do not be negligent, but pray
to the Lord, and he will heal you.
<br>[<b>10</b>] Give up your faults and direct your hands aright, and cleanse
your heart from all sin.
<br>[<b>11</b>] Offer a sweet-smelling sacrifice, and a memorial portion
of fine flour, and pour oil on your offering, as much as you can afford.
<br>[<b>12</b>] And give the physician his place, for the Lord created
him; let him not leave you, for there is need of him.
<br>[<b>13</b>] There is a time when success lies in the hands of physicians,
<br>[<b>14</b>] for they too will pray to the Lord that he should grant
them success in diagnosis and in healing, for the sake of preserving life.
<br>[<b>15</b>] He who sins before his Maker, may he fall into the care
of a physician.
<br>[<b>16</b>] My son, let your tears fall for the dead, and as one who
is suffering grievously begin the lament. Lay out his body with the honor
due him, and do not neglect his burial.
<br>[<b>17</b>] Let your weeping be bitter and your wailing fervent; observe
the mourning according to his merit, for one day, or two, to avoid criticism;
then be comforted for your sorrow.
<br>[<b>18</b>] For sorrow results in death, and sorrow of heart saps one's
strength.
<br>[<b>19</b>] In calamity sorrow continues, and the life of the poor
man weighs down his heart.
<br>[<b>20</b>] Do not give your heart to sorrow; drive it away, remembering
the end of life.
<br>[<b>21</b>] Do not forget, there is no coming back; you do the dead
no good, and you injure yourself.
<br>[<b>22</b>] &quot;Remember my doom, for yours is like it: yesterday it was
mine, and today it is yours.&quot;
<br>[<b>23</b>] When the dead is at rest, let his remembrance cease, and
be comforted for him when his spirit is departed.
<br>[<b>24</b>] The wisdom of the scribe depends on the opportunity of
leisure; and he who has little business may become wise.
<br>[<b>25</b>] How can he become wise who handles the plow, and who glories
in the shaft of a goad, who drives oxen and is occupied with their work,
and whose talk is about bulls?
<br>[<b>26</b>] He sets his heart on plowing furrows, and he is careful
about fodder for the heifers.
<br>[<b>27</b>] So too is every craftsman and master workman who labors
by night as well as by day; those who cut the signets of seals, each is
diligent in making a great variety; he sets his heart on painting a lifelike
image, and he is careful to finish his work.
<br>[<b>28</b>] So too is the smith sitting by the anvil, intent upon his
handiwork in iron; the breath of the fire melts his flesh, and he wastes
away in the heat of the furnace; he inclines his ear to the sound of the
hammer, and his eyes are on the pattern of the object. He sets his heart
on finishing his handiwork, and he is careful to complete its decoration.
<br>[<b>29</b>] So too is the potter sitting at his work and turning the
wheel with his feet; he is always deeply concerned over his work, and all
his output is by number.
<br>[<b>30</b>] He moulds the clay with his arm and makes it pliable with
his feet; he sets his heart to finish the glazing, and he is careful to
clean the furnace.
<br>[<b>31</b>] All these rely upon their hands, and each is skilful in
his own work.
<br>[<b>32</b>] Without them a city cannot be established, and men can
neither sojourn nor live there.
<br>[<b>33</b>] Yet they are not sought out for the council of the people,
nor do they attain eminence in the public assembly.
<br>They do not sit in the judge's seat, nor do they understand the sentence
of judgment; they cannot expound discipline or judgment, and they are not
found using proverbs.
<br>[<b>34</b>] But they keep stable the fabric of the world, and their
prayer is in the practice of their trade.

Sir.39</h3>
[<b>1</b>] On the other hand he who devotes himself to the study of the
law of the Most High will seek out the wisdom of all the ancients, and
will be concerned with prophecies;
<br>[<b>2</b>] he will preserve the discourse of notable men and penetrate
the subtleties of parables;
<br>[<b>3</b>] he will seek out the hidden meanings of proverbs and be
at home with the obscurities of parables.
<br>[<b>4</b>] He will serve among great men and appear before rulers;
he will travel through the lands of foreign nations, for he tests the good
and the evil among men.
<br>[<b>5</b>] He will set his heart to rise early to seek the Lord who
made him, and will make supplication before the Most High; he will open
his mouth in prayer and make supplication for his sins.
<br>[<b>6</b>] If the great Lord is willing, he will be filled with the
spirit of understanding; he will pour forth words of wisdom and give thanks
to the Lord in prayer.
<br>[<b>7</b>] He will direct his counsel and knowledge aright, and meditate
on his secrets.
<br>[<b>8</b>] He will reveal instruction in his teaching, and will glory
in the law of the Lord's covenant.
<br>[<b>9</b>] Many will praise his understanding, and it will never be
blotted out; his memory will not disappear, and his name will live through
all generations.
<br>[<b>10</b>] Nations will declare his wisdom, and the congregation will
proclaim his praise;
<br>[<b>11</b>] if he lives long, he will leave a name greater than a thousand,
and if he goes to rest, it is enough for him.
<br>[<b>12</b>] I have yet more to say, which I have thought upon, and
I am filled, like the moon at the full.
<br>[<b>13</b>] Listen to me, O you holy sons, and bud like a rose growing
by a stream of water;
<br>[<b>14</b>] send forth fragrance like frankincense, and put forth blossoms
like a lily. Scatter the fragrance, and sing a hymn of praise; bless the
Lord for all his works;
<br>[<b>15</b>] ascribe majesty to his name and give thanks to him with
praise, with songs on your lips, and with lyres; and this you shall say
in thanksgiving:
<br>[<b>16</b>] &quot;All things are the works of the Lord, for they are very
good, and whatever he commands will be done in his time.&quot;
<br>[<b>17</b>] No one can say, &quot;What is this?&quot; &quot;Why is that?&quot; for in God's
time all things will be sought after. At his word the waters stood in a
heap, and the reservoirs of water at the word of his mouth.
<br>[<b>18</b>] At his command whatever pleases him is done, and none can
limit his saving power.
<br>[<b>19</b>] The works of all flesh are before him, and nothing can
be hid from his eyes.
<br>[<b>20</b>] From everlasting to everlasting he beholds them, and nothing
is marvelous to him.
<br>[<b>21</b>] No one can say, &quot;What is this?&quot; &quot;Why is that?&quot; for everything
has been created for its use.
<br>[<b>22</b>] His blessing covers the dry land like a river, and drenches
it like a flood.
<br>[<b>23</b>] The nations will incur his wrath, just as he turns fresh
water into salt.
<br>[<b>24</b>] To the holy his ways are straight, just as they are obstacles
to the wicked.
<br>[<b>25</b>] From the beginning good things were created for good people,
just as evil things for sinners.
<br>[<b>26</b>] Basic to all the needs of man's life are water and fire
and iron and salt and wheat flour and milk and honey, the blood of the
grape, and oil and clothing.
<br>[<b>27</b>] All these are for good to the godly, just as they turn
into evils for sinners.
<br>[<b>28</b>] There are winds that have been created for vengeance, and
in their anger they scourge heavily; in the time of consummation they will
pour out their strength and calm the anger of their Maker.
<br>[<b>29</b>] Fire and hail and famine and pestilence, all these have
been created for vengeance;
<br>[<b>30</b>] the teeth of wild beasts, and scorpions and vipers, and
the sword that punishes the ungodly with destruction;
<br>[<b>31</b>] they will rejoice in his commands, and be made ready on
earth for their service, and when their times come they will not transgress
his word.
<br>[<b>32</b>] Therefore from the beginning I have been convinced, and
have thought this out and left it in writing:
<br>[<b>33</b>] The works of the Lord are all good, and he will supply
every need in its hour.
<br>[<b>34</b>] And no one can say, &quot;This is worse than that,&quot; for all
things will prove good in their season.
<br>[<b>35</b>] So now sing praise with all your heart and voice, and bless
the name of the Lord.

[<b>1</b>] Much labor was created for every man, and a heavy yoke is upon
the sons of Adam, from the day they come forth from their mother's womb
till the day they return to the mother of all.
<br>[<b>2</b>] Their perplexities and fear of heart -- their anxious thought
is the day of death,
<br>[<b>3</b>] from the man who sits on a splendid throne to the one who
is humbled in dust and ashes,
<br>[<b>4</b>] from the man who wears purple and a crown to the one who
is clothed in burlap;
<br>[<b>5</b>] there is anger and envy and trouble and unrest, and fear
of death, and fury and strife. And when one rests upon his bed, his sleep
at night confuses his mind.
<br>[<b>6</b>] He gets little or no rest, and afterward in his sleep, as
though he were on watch, he is troubled by the visions of his mind like
one who has escaped from the battle-front;
<br>[<b>7</b>] at the moment of his rescue he wakes up, and wonders that
his fear came to nothing.
<br>[<b>8</b>] With all flesh, both man and beast, and upon sinners seven
times more,
<br>[<b>9</b>] are death and bloodshed and strife and sword, calamities,
famine and affliction and plague.
<br>[<b>10</b>] All these were created for the wicked, and on their account
the flood came.
<br>[<b>11</b>] All things that are from the earth turn back to the earth,
and what is from the waters returns to the sea.
<br>[<b>12</b>] All bribery and injustice will be blotted out, but good
faith will stand for ever.
<br>[<b>13</b>] The wealth of the unjust will dry up like a torrent, and
crash like a loud clap of thunder in a rain.
<br>[<b>14</b>] A generous man will be made glad; likewise transgressors
will utterly fail.
<br>[<b>15</b>] The children of the ungodly will not put forth many branches;
they are unhealthy roots upon sheer rock.
<br>[<b>16</b>] The reeds by any water or river bank will be plucked up
before any grass.
<br>[<b>17</b>] Kindness is like a garden of blessings, and almsgiving
endures for ever.
<br>[<b>18</b>] Life is sweet for the self-reliant and the worker, but
he who finds treasure is better off than both.
<br>[<b>19</b>] Children and the building of a city establish a man's name,
but a blameless wife is accounted better than both.
<br>[<b>20</b>] Wine and music gladden the heart, but the love of wisdom
is better than both.
<br>[<b>21</b>] The flute and the harp make pleasant melody, but a pleasant
voice is better than both.
<br>[<b>22</b>] The eye desires grace and beauty, but the green shoots
of grain more than both.
<br>[<b>23</b>] A friend or a companion never meets one amiss, but a wife
with her husband is better than both.
<br>[<b>24</b>] Brothers and help are for a time of trouble, but almsgiving
rescues better than both.
<br>[<b>25</b>] Gold and silver make the foot stand sure, but good counsel
is esteemed more than both.
<br>[<b>26</b>] Riches and strength lift up the heart, but the fear of
the Lord is better than both. There is no loss in the fear of the Lord,
and with it there is no need to seek for help.
<br>[<b>27</b>] The fear of the Lord is like a garden of blessing, and
covers a man better than any glory.
<br>[<b>28</b>] My son, do not lead the life of a beggar; it is better
to die than to beg.
<br>[<b>29</b>] When a man looks to the table of another, his existence
cannot be considered as life. He pollutes himself with another man's food,
but a man who is intelligent and well instructed guards against that.

[<b>1</b>] O death, how bitter is the reminder of you to one who lives
at peace among his possessions, to a man without distractions, who is prosperous
in everything, and who still has the vigor to enjoy his food!
<br>[<b>2</b>] O death, how welcome is your sentence to one who is in need
and is failing in strength, very old and distracted over everything; to
one who is contrary, and has lost his patience!
<br>[<b>3</b>] Do not fear the sentence of death; remember your former
days and the end of life; this is the decree from the Lord for all flesh,
<br>[<b>4</b>] and how can you reject the good pleasure of the Most High?
Whether life is for ten or a hundred or a thousand years,
<br>there is no inquiry about it in Hades.
<br>[<b>5</b>] The children of sinners are abominable children, and they
frequent the haunts of the ungodly.
<br>[<b>6</b>] The inheritance of the children of sinners will perish,
and on their posterity will be a perpetual reproach.
<br>[<b>7</b>] Children will blame an ungodly father, for they suffer reproach
because of him.
<br>[<b>8</b>] Woe to you, ungodly men, who have forsaken the law of the
Most High God!
<br>[<b>9</b>] When you are born, you are born to a curse; and when you
die, a curse is your lot.

go from curse to destruction.
<br>[<b>11</b>] The mourning of men is about their bodies, but the evil
name of sinners will be blotted out.
<br>[<b>12</b>] Have regard for your name, since it will remain for you
longer than a thousand great stores of gold.
<br>[<b>13</b>] The days of a good life are numbered, but a good name endures
for ever.
<br>[<b>14</b>] My children, observe instruction and be at peace; hidden
wisdom and unseen treasure, what advantage is there in either of them?
<br>[<b>15</b>] Better is the man who hides his folly than the man who
hides his wisdom.
<br>[<b>16</b>] Therefore show respect for my words: For it is good to
retain every kind of shame, and not everything is confidently esteemed
by every one.
<br>[<b>17</b>] Be ashamed of immorality, before your father or mother;
and of a lie, before a prince or a ruler;
<br>[<b>18</b>] of a transgression, before a judge or magistrate; and of
iniquity, before a congregation or the people; of unjust dealing, before
your partner or friend;
<br>[<b>19</b>] and of theft, in the place where you live. Be ashamed before
the truth of God and his covenant. Be ashamed of selfish behavior at meals,
of surliness in receiving and giving,
<br>[<b>20</b>] and of silence, before those who greet you; of looking
at a woman who is a harlot,
<br>[<b>21</b>] and of rejecting the appeal of a kinsman; of taking away
some one's portion or gift, and of gazing at another man's wife;
<br>[<b>22</b>] of meddling with his maidservant -- and do not approach
her bed; of abusive words, before friends -- and do not upbraid after making
a gift;

[<b>1</b>] Of the following things do not be ashamed, and do not let partiality
lead you to sin:
<br>[<b>2</b>] of the law of the Most High and his covenant, and of rendering
judgment to acquit the ungodly;
<br>[<b>3</b>] of keeping accounts with a partner or with traveling companions,
and of dividing the inheritance of friends;

or little;
<br>[<b>5</b>] of profit from dealing with merchants, and of much discipline
of children, and of whipping a wicked servant severely.
<br>[<b>6</b>] Where there is an evil wife, a seal is a good thing; and
where there are many hands, lock things up.
<br>[<b>7</b>] Whatever you deal out, let it be by number and weight, and
make a record of all that you give out or take in.
<br>[<b>8</b>] Do not be ashamed to instruct the stupid or foolish or the
aged man who quarrels with the young. Then you will be truly instructed,
and will be approved before all men.
<br>[<b>9</b>] A daughter keeps her father secretly wakeful, and worry
over her robs him of sleep; when she is young, lest she do not marry, or
if married, lest she be hated;
<br>[<b>10</b>] while a virgin, lest she be defiled or become pregnant
in her father's house; or having a husband, lest she prove unfaithful,
or, though married, lest she be barren.
<br>[<b>11</b>] Keep strict watch over a headstrong daughter, lest she
make you a laughingstock to your enemies, a byword in the city and notorious
among the people, and put you to shame before the great multitude.
<br>[<b>12</b>] Do not look upon any one for beauty, and do not sit in
the midst of women;
<br>[<b>13</b>] for from garments comes the moth, and from a woman comes
woman's wickedness.
<br>[<b>14</b>] Better is the wickedness of a man than a woman who does
good; and it is a woman who brings shame and disgrace.
<br>[<b>15</b>] I will now call to mind the works of the Lord, and will
declare what I have seen. By the words of the Lord his works are done.
<br>[<b>16</b>] The sun looks down on everything with its light, and the
work of the Lord is full of his glory.
<br>[<b>17</b>] The Lord has not enabled his holy ones to recount all his
marvelous works, which the Lord the Almighty has established that the universe
may stand firm in his glory.
<br>[<b>18</b>] He searches out the abyss, and the hearts of men, and considers
their crafty devices. For the Most High knows all that may be known, and
he looks into the signs of the age.
<br>[<b>19</b>] He declares what has been and what is to be, and he reveals
the tracks of hidden things.
<br>[<b>20</b>] No thought escapes him, and not one word is hidden from
him.
<br>[<b>21</b>] He has ordained the splendors of his wisdom, and he is
from everlasting and to everlasting. Nothing can be added or taken away,
and he needs no one to be his counselor.
<br>[<b>22</b>] How greatly to be desired are all his works, and how sparkling
they are to see!
<br>[<b>23</b>] All these things live and remain for ever for every need,
and are all obedient.
<br>[<b>24</b>] All things are twofold, one opposite the other, and he
has made nothing incomplete.
<br>[<b>25</b>] One confirms the good things of the other, and who can
have enough of beholding his glory?

Sir.43</h3>
[<b>1</b>] The pride of the heavenly heights is the clear firmament, the
appearance of heaven in a spectacle of glory.
<br>[<b>2</b>] The sun, when it appears, making proclamation as it goes
forth, is a marvelous instrument, the work of the Most High.
<br>[<b>3</b>] At noon it parches the land; and who can withstand its burning
heat?
<br>[<b>4</b>] A man tending a furnace works in burning heat, but the sun
burns the mountains three times as much; it breathes out fiery vapors,
and with bright beams it blinds the eyes.
<br>[<b>5</b>] Great is the Lord who made it; and at his command it hastens
on its course.
<br>[<b>6</b>] He made the moon also, to serve in its season to mark the
times and to be an everlasting sign.
<br>[<b>7</b>] From the moon comes the sign for feast days, a light that
wanes when it has reached the full.
<br>[<b>8</b>] The month is named for the moon, increasing marvelously
in its phases, an instrument of the hosts on high shining forth in the
firmament of heaven.
<br>[<b>9</b>] The glory of the stars is the beauty of heaven, a gleaming
array in the heights of the Lord.
<br>[<b>10</b>] At the command of the Holy One they stand as ordered, they
never relax in their watches.
<br>[<b>11</b>] Look upon the rainbow, and praise him who made it, exceedingly
beautiful in its brightness.
<br>[<b>12</b>] It encircles the heaven with its glorious arc; the hands
of the Most High have stretched it out.
<br>[<b>13</b>] By his command he sends the driving snow and speeds the
lightnings of his judgment.
<br>[<b>14</b>] Therefore the storehouses are opened, and the clouds fly
forth like birds.
<br>[<b>15</b>] In his majesty he amasses the clouds, and the hailstones
are broken in pieces.
<br>[<b>16</b>] At his appearing the mountains are shaken; at his will
the south wind blows.
<br>[<b>17</b>] The voice of his thunder rebukes the earth; so do the tempest
from the north and the whirlwind. He scatters the snow like birds flying
down, and its descent is like locusts alighting.
<br>[<b>18</b>] The eye marvels at the beauty of its whiteness, and the
mind is amazed at its falling.
<br>[<b>19</b>] He pours the hoarfrost upon the earth like salt, and when
it freezes, it becomes pointed thorns.
<br>[<b>20</b>] The cold north wind blows, and ice freezes over the water;
it rests upon every pool of water, and the water puts it on like a breastplate.
<br>[<b>21</b>] He consumes the mountains and burns up the wilderness,
and withers the tender grass like fire.
<br>[<b>22</b>] A mist quickly heals all things; when the dew appears,
it refreshes from the heat.
<br>[<b>23</b>] By his counsel he stilled the great deep and planted islands
in it.
<br>[<b>24</b>] Those who sail the sea tell of its dangers, and we marvel
at what we hear.
<br>[<b>25</b>] for in it are strange and marvelous works, all kinds of
living things, and huge creatures of the sea.
<br>[<b>26</b>] Because of him his messenger finds the way, and by his
word all things hold together.
<br>[<b>27</b>] Though we speak much we cannot reach the end, and the sum
of our words is: &quot;He is the all.&quot;
<br>[<b>28</b>] Where shall we find strength to praise him? For he is greater
than all his works.
<br>[<b>29</b>] Terrible is the Lord and very great, and marvelous is his
power.
<br>[<b>30</b>] When you praise the Lord, exalt him as much as you can;
for he will surpass even that. When you exalt him, put forth all your strength,
and do not grow weary, for you cannot praise him enough.
<br>[<b>31</b>] Who has seen him and can describe him? Or who can extol
him as he is?
<br>[<b>32</b>] Many things greater than these lie hidden, for we have
seen but few of his works.
<br>[<b>33</b>] For the Lord has made all things, and to the godly he has
granted wisdom.

Sir.44</h3>
[<b>1</b>] Let us now praise famous men, and our fathers in their generations.
<br>[<b>2</b>] The Lord apportioned to them great glory, his majesty from
the beginning.
<br>[<b>3</b>] There were those who ruled in their kingdoms, and were men
renowned for their power, giving counsel by their understanding, and proclaiming
prophecies;
<br>[<b>4</b>] leaders of the people in their deliberations and in understanding
of learning for the people, wise in their words of instruction;
<br>[<b>5</b>] those who composed musical tunes, and set forth verses in
writing;
<br>[<b>6</b>] rich men furnished with resources, living peaceably in their
habitations --
<br>[<b>7</b>] all these were honored in their generations, and were the
glory of their times.
<br>[<b>8</b>] There are some of them who have left a name, so that men
declare their praise.
<br>[<b>9</b>] And there are some who have no memorial, who have perished
as though they had not lived; they have become as though they had not been
born, and so have their children after them.
<br>[<b>10</b>] But these were men of mercy, whose righteous deeds have
not been forgotten;
<br>[<b>11</b>] their prosperity will remain with their descendants, and
their inheritance to their children's children.
<br>[<b>12</b>] Their descendants stand by the covenants; their children
also, for their sake.
<br>[<b>13</b>] Their posterity will continue for ever, and their glory
will not be blotted out.
<br>[<b>14</b>] Their bodies were buried in peace, and their name lives
to all generations.
<br>[<b>15</b>] Peoples will declare their wisdom, and the congregation
proclaims their praise.
<br>[<b>16</b>] Enoch pleased the Lord, and was taken up; he was an example
of repentance to all generations.
<br>[<b>17</b>] Noah was found perfect and righteous; in the time of wrath
he was taken in exchange; therefore a remnant was left to the earth when
the flood came.
<br>[<b>18</b>] Everlasting covenants were made with him that all flesh
should not be blotted out by a flood.
<br>[<b>19</b>] Abraham was the great father of a multitude of nations,
and no one has been found like him in glory;
<br>[<b>20</b>] he kept the law of the Most High, and was taken into covenant
with him; he established the covenant in his flesh, and when he was tested
he was found faithful.
<br>[<b>21</b>] Therefore the Lord assured him by an oath that the nations
would be blessed through his posterity; that he would multiply him like
the dust of the earth, and exalt his posterity like the stars, and cause
them to inherit from sea to sea and from the River to the ends of the earth.
<br>[<b>22</b>] To Isaac also he gave the same assurance for the sake of
Abraham his father.
<br>[<b>23</b>] The blessing of all men and the covenant he made to rest
upon the head of Jacob; he acknowledged him with his blessings, and gave
him his inheritance; he determined his portions, and distributed them among
twelve tribes.

Sir.45</h3>
[<b>1</b>] From his descendants the Lord brought forth a man of mercy,
who found favor in the sight of all flesh and was beloved by God and man,
Moses, whose memory is blessed.
<br>[<b>2</b>] He made him equal in glory to the holy ones, and made him
great in the fears of his enemies.
<br>[<b>3</b>] By his words he caused signs to cease; the Lord glorified
him in the presence of kings. He gave him commands for his people, and
showed him part of his glory.
<br>[<b>4</b>] He sanctified him through faithfulness and meekness; he
chose him out of all mankind.
<br>[<b>5</b>] He made him hear his voice, and led him into the thick darkness,
and gave him the commandments face to face, the law of life and knowledge,
to teach Jacob the covenant, and Israel his judgments.
<br>[<b>6</b>] He exalted Aaron, the brother of Moses, a holy man like
him, of the tribe of Levi.
<br>[<b>7</b>] He made an everlasting covenant with him, and gave him the
priesthood of the people. He blessed him with splendid vestments, and put
a glorious robe upon him.
<br>[<b>8</b>] He clothed him with superb perfection, and strengthened
him with the symbols of authority, the linen breeches, the long robe, and
the ephod.
<br>[<b>9</b>] And he encircled him with pomegranates, with very many golden
bells round about, to send forth a sound as he walked, to make their ringing
heard in the temple as a reminder to the sons of his people;
<br>[<b>10</b>] with a holy garment, of gold and blue and purple, the work
of an embroiderer; with the oracle of judgment, Urim and Thummim;
<br>[<b>11</b>] with twisted scarlet, the work of a craftsman; with precious
stones engraved like signets, in a setting of gold, the work of a jeweler,
for a reminder, in engraved letters, according to the number of the tribes
of Israel;
<br>[<b>12</b>] with a gold crown upon his turban, inscribed like a signet
with &quot;Holiness,&quot; a distinction to be prized, the work of an expert, the
delight of the eyes, richly adorned.
<br>[<b>13</b>] Before his time there never were such beautiful things.
No outsider ever put them on, but only his sons and his descendants perpetually.
<br>[<b>14</b>] His sacrifices shall be wholly burned twice every day continually.
<br>[<b>15</b>] Moses ordained him, and anointed him with holy oil; it
was an everlasting covenant for him and for his descendants all the days
of heaven, to minister to the Lord and serve as priest and bless his people
in his name.
<br>[<b>16</b>] He chose him out of all the living to offer sacrifice to
the Lord, incense and a pleasing odor as a memorial portion, to make atonement
for the people.
<br>[<b>17</b>] In his commandments he gave him authority and statutes
and judgments, to teach Jacob the testimonies, and to enlighten Israel
with his law.
<br>[<b>18</b>] Outsiders conspired against him, and envied him in the
wilderness, Dathan and Abiram and their men and the company of Korah, in
wrath and anger.
<br>[<b>19</b>] The Lord saw it and was not pleased, and in the wrath of
his anger they were destroyed; he wrought wonders against them to consume
them in flaming fire.
<br>[<b>20</b>] He added glory to Aaron and gave him a heritage; he allotted
to him the first of the first fruits, he prepared bread of first fruits
in abundance;
<br>[<b>21</b>] for they eat the sacrifices to the Lord, which he gave
to him and his descendants.
<br>[<b>22</b>] But in the land of the people he has no inheritance, and
he has no portion among the people; for the Lord himself is his portion
and inheritance.
<br>[<b>23</b>] Phinehas the son of Eleazar is the third in glory, for
he was zealous in the fear of the Lord, and stood fast, when the people
turned away, in the ready goodness of his soul, and made atonement for
Israel.
<br>[<b>24</b>] Therefore a covenant of peace was established with him,
that he should be leader of the sanctuary and of his people,
<br>that he and his descendants should have the dignity of the priesthood
for ever.
<br>[<b>25</b>] A covenant was also established with David, the son of
Jesse, of the tribe of Judah: the heritage of the king is from son to son
only; so the heritage of Aaron is for his descendants.
<br>[<b>26</b>] May the Lord grant you wisdom in your heart to judge his
people in righteousness, so that their prosperity may not vanish, and that
their glory may endure throughout their generations.

[<b>1</b>] Joshua the son of Nun was mighty in war, and was the successor
of Moses in prophesying. He became, in accordance with his name, a great
savior of God's elect, to take vengeance on the enemies that rose against
them, so that he might give Israel its inheritance.
<br>[<b>2</b>] How glorious he was when he lifted his hands and stretched
out his sword against the cities!
<br>[<b>3</b>] Who before him ever stood so firm? For he waged the wars
of the Lord.
<br>[<b>4</b>] Was not the sun held back by his hand? And did not one day
become as long as two?
<br>[<b>5</b>] He called upon the Most High, the Mighty One, when enemies
pressed him on every side,
<br>[<b>6</b>] and the great Lord answered him with hailstones of mighty
power. He hurled down war upon that nation, and at the descent of Beth-horon
he destroyed those who resisted, so that the nations might know his armament,
that he was fighting in the sight of the Lord; for he wholly followed the
Mighty One.
<br>[<b>7</b>] And in the days of Moses he did a loyal deed, he and Caleb
the son of Jephunneh: they withstood the congregation,
<br>restrained the people from sin, and stilled their wicked murmuring.
<br>[<b>8</b>] And these two alone were preserved out of six hundred thousand
people on foot, to bring them into their inheritance,
<br>into a land flowing with milk and honey.
<br>[<b>9</b>] And the Lord gave Caleb strength, which remained with him
to old age, so that he went up to the hill country, and his children obtained
it for an inheritance;
<br>[<b>10</b>] so that all the sons of Israel might see that it is good
to follow the Lord.
<br>[<b>11</b>] The judges also, with their respective names, those whose
hearts did not fall into idolatry and who did not turn away from the Lord
-- may their memory be blessed!
<br>[<b>12</b>] May their bones revive from where they lie, and may the
name of those who have been honored live again in their sons!
<br>[<b>13</b>] Samuel, beloved by his Lord, a prophet of the Lord, established
the kingdom and anointed rulers over his people.
<br>[<b>14</b>] By the law of the Lord he judged the congregation, and
the Lord watched over Jacob.
<br>[<b>15</b>] By his faithfulness he was proved to be a prophet, and
by his words he became known as a trustworthy seer.
<br>[<b>16</b>] He called upon the Lord, the Mighty One, when his enemies
pressed him on every side, and he offered in sacrifice a sucking lamb.
<br>[<b>17</b>] Then the Lord thundered from heaven, and made his voice
heard with a mighty sound;
<br>[<b>18</b>] and he wiped out the leaders of the people of Tyre and
all the rulers of the Philistines.
<br>[<b>19</b>] Before the time of his eternal sleep, Samuel called men
to witness before the Lord and his anointed: &quot;I have not taken any one's
property, not so much as a pair of shoes.&quot; And no man accused him.
<br>[<b>20</b>] Even after he had fallen asleep he prophesied and revealed
to the king his death, and lifted up his voice out of the earth in prophecy,
to blot out the wickedness of the people.

[<b>1</b>] And after him Nathan rose up to prophesy in the days of David.
<br>[<b>2</b>] As the fat is selected from the peace offering, so David
was selected from the sons of Israel.
<br>[<b>3</b>] He played with lions as with young goats, and with bears
as with lambs of the flock.
<br>[<b>4</b>] In his youth did he not kill a giant, and take away reproach
from the people, when he lifted his hand with a stone in the sling and
struck down the boasting of Goliath?
<br>[<b>5</b>] For he appealed to the Lord, the Most High, and he gave
him strength in his right hand to slay a man mighty in war, to exalt the
power of his people.
<br>[<b>6</b>] So they glorified him for his ten thousands, and praised
him for the blessings of the Lord, when the glorious diadem was bestowed
upon him.
<br>[<b>7</b>] For he wiped out his enemies on every side, and annihilated
his adversaries the Philistines; he crushed their power even to this day.
<br>[<b>8</b>] In all that he did he gave thanks to the Holy One, the Most
High, with ascriptions of glory; he sang praise with all his heart, and
he loved his Maker.
<br>[<b>9</b>] He placed singers before the altar, to make sweet melody
with their voices.
<br>[<b>10</b>] He gave beauty to the feasts, and arranged their times
throughout the year, while they praised God's holy name, and the sanctuary
resounded from early morning.
<br>[<b>11</b>] The Lord took away his sins, and exalted his power for
ever; he gave him the covenant of kings and a throne of glory in Israel.
<br>[<b>12</b>] After him rose up a wise son who fared amply because of
him;
<br>[<b>13</b>] Solomon reigned in days of peace, and God gave him rest
on every side, that he might build a house for his name and prepare a sanctuary
to stand for ever.
<br>[<b>14</b>] How wise you became in your youth! You overflowed like
a river with understanding.
<br>[<b>15</b>] Your soul covered the earth, and you filled it with parables
and riddles.
<br>[<b>16</b>] Your name reached to far-off islands, and you were loved
for your peace.
<br>[<b>17</b>] For your songs and proverbs and parables, and for your
interpretations, the countries marveled at you.
<br>[<b>18</b>] In the name of the Lord God, who is called the God of Israel,
you gathered gold like tin and amassed silver like lead.
<br>[<b>19</b>] But you laid your loins beside women, and through your
body you were brought into subjection.
<br>[<b>20</b>] You put stain upon your honor, and defiled your posterity,
so that you brought wrath upon your children and they were grieved at your
folly,
<br>[<b>21</b>] so that the sovereignty was divided and a disobedient kingdom
arose out of Ephraim.
<br>[<b>22</b>] But the Lord will never give up his mercy, nor cause any
of his works to perish; he will never blot out the descendants of his chosen
one, nor destroy the posterity of him who loved him; so he gave a remnant
to Jacob, and to David a root of his stock.
<br>[<b>23</b>] Solomon rested with his fathers, and left behind him one
of his sons, ample in folly and lacking in understanding,
<br>Rehoboam, whose policy caused the people to revolt. Also Jeroboam the
son of Nebat, who caused Israel to sin and gave to Ephraim a sinful way.
<br>[<b>24</b>] Their sins became exceedingly many, so as to remove them
from their land.
<br>[<b>25</b>] For they sought out every sort of wickedness, till vengeance
came upon them.

[<b>1</b>] Then the prophet Elijah arose like a fire, and his word burned
like a torch.
<br>[<b>2</b>] He brought a famine upon them, and by his zeal he made them
few in number.
<br>[<b>3</b>] By the word of the Lord he shut up the heavens, and also
three times brought down fire.
<br>[<b>4</b>] How glorious you were, O Elijah, in your wondrous deeds!
And who has the right to boast which you have?
<br>[<b>5</b>] You who raised a corpse from death and from Hades, by the
word of the Most High;
<br>[<b>6</b>] who brought kings down to destruction, and famous men from
their beds;
<br>[<b>7</b>] who heard rebuke at Sinai and judgments of vengeance at
Horeb;
<br>[<b>8</b>] who anointed kings to inflict retribution, and prophets
to succeed you.
<br>[<b>9</b>] You who were taken up by a whirlwind of fire, in a chariot
with horses of fire;
<br>[<b>10</b>] you who are ready at the appointed time, it is written,
to calm the wrath of God before it breaks out in fury, to turn the heart
of the father to the son, and to restore the tribes of Jacob.
<br>[<b>11</b>] Blessed are those who saw you, and those who have been
adorned in love; for we also shall surely live.
<br>[<b>12</b>] It was Elijah who was covered by the whirlwind, and Elisha
was filled with his spirit; in all his days he did not tremble before any
ruler, and no one brought him into subjection.
<br>[<b>13</b>] Nothing was too hard for him, and when he was dead his
body prophesied.
<br>[<b>14</b>] As in his life he did wonders, so in death his deeds were
marvelous.
<br>[<b>15</b>] For all this the people did not repent, and they did not
forsake their sins, till they were carried away captive from their land
and were scattered over all the earth; the people were left very few in
number, but with rulers from the house of David.
<br>[<b>16</b>] Some of them did what was pleasing to God, but others multiplied
sins.
<br>[<b>17</b>] Hezekiah fortified his city, and brought water into the
midst of it; he tunneled the sheer rock with iron and built pools for water.
<br>[<b>18</b>] In his days Sennacherib came up, and sent the Rabshakeh;
he lifted up his hand against Zion and made great boasts in his arrogance.
<br>[<b>19</b>] Then their hearts were shaken and their hands trembled,
and they were in anguish, like women in travail.
<br>[<b>20</b>] But they called upon the Lord who is merciful, spreading
forth their hands toward him; and the Holy One quickly heard them from
heaven, and delivered them by the hand of Isaiah.
<br>[<b>21</b>] The Lord smote the camp of the Assyrians, and his angel
wiped them out.
<br>[<b>22</b>] For Hezekiah did what was pleasing to the Lord, and he
held strongly to the ways of David his father, which Isaiah the prophet
commanded, who was great and faithful in his vision.
<br>[<b>23</b>] In his days the sun went backward, and he lengthened the
life of the king.
<br>[<b>24</b>] By the spirit of might he saw the last things, and comforted
those who mourned in Zion.
<br>[<b>25</b>] He revealed what was to occur to the end of time, and the
hidden things before they came to pass.

[<b>1</b>] The memory of Josiah is like a blending of incense prepared

music at a banquet of wine.
<br>[<b>2</b>] He was led aright in converting the people, and took away
the abominations of iniquity.
<br>[<b>3</b>] He set his heart upon the Lord; in the days of wicked men
he strengthened godliness.
<br>[<b>4</b>] Except David and Hezekiah and Josiah they all sinned greatly,
for they forsook the law of the Most High; the kings of Judah came to an
end;
<br>[<b>5</b>] for they gave their power to others, and their glory to
a foreign nation,
<br>[<b>6</b>] who set fire to the chosen city of the sanctuary, and made
her streets desolate, according to the word of Jeremiah.
<br>[<b>7</b>] For they had afflicted him; yet he had been consecrated
in the womb as prophet, to pluck up and afflict and destroy,
<br>and likewise to build and to plant.
<br>[<b>8</b>] It was Ezekiel who saw the vision of glory which God showed
him above the chariot of the cherubim.
<br>[<b>9</b>] For God remembered his enemies with storm, and did good
to those who directed their ways aright.
<br>[<b>10</b>] May the bones of the twelve prophets revive from where
they lie, for they comforted the people of Jacob and delivered them with
confident hope.
<br>[<b>11</b>] How shall we magnify Zerubbabel? He was like a signet on
the right hand,
<br>[<b>12</b>] and so was Jeshua the son of Jozadak; in their days they
built the house and raised a temple holy to the Lord,
<br>prepared for everlasting glory.
<br>[<b>13</b>] The memory of Nehemiah also is lasting; he raised for us
the walls that had fallen, and set up the gates and bars and rebuilt our
ruined houses.
<br>[<b>14</b>] No one like Enoch has been created on earth, for he was
taken up from the earth.
<br>[<b>15</b>] And no man like Joseph has been born, and his bones are
cared for.

[<b>1</b>] The leader of his brethren and the pride of his people was Simon
the high priest, son of Onias, who in his life repaired the house, and
in his time fortified the temple.
<br>[<b>2</b>] He laid the foundations for the high double walls, the high
retaining walls for the temple enclosure.
<br>[<b>3</b>] In his days a cistern for water was quarried out, a reservoir
like the sea in circumference.
<br>[<b>4</b>] He considered how to save his people from ruin, and fortified
the city to withstand a seige.
<br>[<b>5</b>] How glorious he was when the people gathered round him as
he came out of the inner sanctuary!
<br>[<b>6</b>] Like the morning star among the clouds, like the moon when
it is full;
<br>[<b>7</b>] like the sun shining upon the temple of the Most High, and
like the rainbow gleaming in glorious clouds;
<br>[<b>8</b>] like roses in the days of the first fruits, like lilies
by a spring of water, like a green shoot on Lebanon on a summer day;
<br>[<b>9</b>] like fire and incense in the censer, like a vessel of hammered
gold adorned with all kinds of precious stones;
<br>[<b>10</b>] like an olive tree putting forth its fruit, and like a
cypress towering in the clouds.
<br>[<b>11</b>] When he put on his glorious robe and clothed himself with
superb perfection and went up to the holy altar, he made the court of the
sanctuary glorious.
<br>[<b>12</b>] And when he received the portions from the hands of the
priests, as he stood by the hearth of the altar with a garland of brethren
around him, he was like a young cedar on Lebanon; and they surrounded him
like the trunks of palm trees,
<br>[<b>13</b>] all the sons of Aaron in their splendor with the Lord's
offering in their hands, before the whole congregation of Israel.
<br>[<b>14</b>] Finishing the service at the altars, and arranging the
offering to the Most High, the Almighty,
<br>[<b>15</b>] he reached out his hand to the cup and poured a libation
of the blood of the grape; he poured it out at the foot of the altar, a
pleasing odor to the Most High, the King of all.
<br>[<b>16</b>] Then the sons of Aaron shouted, they sounded the trumpets
of hammered work, they made a great noise to be heard
<br>for remembrance before the Most High.
<br>[<b>17</b>] Then all the people together made haste and fell to the
ground upon their faces to worship their Lord, the Almighty, God Most High.
<br>[<b>18</b>] And the singers praised him with their voices in sweet
and full-toned melody.
<br>[<b>19</b>] And the people besought the Lord Most High in prayer before
him who is merciful, till the order of worship of the Lord was ended; so
they completed his service.
<br>[<b>20</b>] Then Simon came down, and lifted up his hands over the
whole congregation of the sons of Israel, to pronounce the blessing of
the Lord with his lips, and to glory in his name;
<br>[<b>21</b>] and they bowed down in worship a second time, to receive
the blessing from the Most High.
<br>[<b>22</b>] And now bless the God of all, who in every way does great
things; who exalts our days from birth, and deals with us according to
his mercy.
<br>[<b>23</b>] May he give us gladness of heart, and grant that peace
may be in our days in Israel, as in the days of old.
<br>[<b>24</b>] May he entrust to us his mercy! And let him deliver us
in our days!
<br>[<b>25</b>] With two nations my soul is vexed, and the third is no
nation:
<br>[<b>26</b>] Those who live on Mount Seir, and the Philistines, and
the foolish people that dwell in Shechem.
<br>[<b>27</b>] Instruction in understanding and knowledge I have written
in this book, Jesus the son of Sirach, son of Eleazar, of Jerusalem, who
out of his heart poured forth wisdom.
<br>[<b>28</b>] Blessed is he who concerns himself with these things, and
he who lays them to heart will become wise.
<br>[<b>29</b>] For if he does them, he will be strong for all things,
for the light of the Lord is his path.

<h3>
Sir.51</h3>
[<b>1</b>] I will give thanks to thee, O Lord and King, and will praise
thee as God my Savior. I give thanks to thy name,
<br>[<b>2</b>] for thou hast been my protector and helper and hast delivered
my body from destruction and from the snare of a slanderous tongue, from
lips that utter lies. Before those who stood by thou wast my helper,
<br>[<b>3</b>] and didst deliver me, in the greatness of thy mercy and
of thy name, from the gnashings of teeth about to devour me,
<br>from the hand of those who sought my life, from the many afflictions
that I endured,
<br>[<b>4</b>] from choking fire on every side and from the midst of fire
which I did not kindle,
<br>[<b>5</b>] from the depths of the belly of Hades, from an unclean tongue
and lying words --
<br>[<b>6</b>] the slander of an unrighteous tongue to the king. My soul
drew near to death, and my life was very near to Hades beneath.
<br>[<b>7</b>] They surrounded me on every side, and there was no one to
help me; I looked for the assistance of men, and there was none.
<br>[<b>8</b>] Then I remembered thy mercy, O Lord, and thy work from of
old, that thou dost deliver those who wait for thee and dost save them
from the hand of their enemies.
<br>[<b>9</b>] And I sent up my supplication from the earth, and prayed
for deliverance from death.
<br>[<b>10</b>] I appealed to the Lord, the Father of my lord, not to forsake
me in the days of affliction, at the time when there is no help against
the proud.
<br>[<b>11</b>] I will praise thy name continually, and will sing praise
with thanksgiving. My prayer was heard,
<br>[<b>12</b>] for thou didst save me from destruction and rescue me from
an evil plight. Therefore I will give thanks to thee and praise thee, and
I will bless the name of the Lord.
<br>[<b>13</b>] While I was still young, before I went on my travels, I
sought wisdom openly in my prayer.
<br>[<b>14</b>] Before the temple I asked for her, and I will search for
her to the last.
<br>[<b>15</b>] From blossom to ripening grape my heart delighted in her;
my foot entered upon the straight path; from my youth I followed her steps.
<br>[<b>16</b>] I inclined my ear a little and received her, and I found
for myself much instruction.
<br>[<b>17</b>] I made progress therein; to him who gives wisdom I will
give glory.
<br>[<b>18</b>] For I resolved to live according to wisdom, and I was zealous
for the good; and I shall never be put to shame.
<br>[<b>19</b>] My soul grappled with wisdom, and in my conduct I was strict;
I spread out my hands to the heavens, and lamented my ignorance of her.
<br>[<b>20</b>] I directed my soul to her, and through purification I found
her. I gained understanding with her from the first,
<br>therefore I will not be forsaken.
<br>[<b>21</b>] My heart was stirred to seek her, therefore I have gained
a good possession.
<br>[<b>22</b>] The Lord gave me a tongue as my reward, and I will praise
him with it.
<br>[<b>23</b>] Draw near to me, you who are untaught, and lodge in my
school.
<br>[<b>24</b>] Why do you say you are lacking in these things, and why
are your souls very thirsty?
<br>[<b>25</b>] I opened my mouth and said, Get these things for yourselves
without money.
<br>[<b>26</b>] Put your neck under the yoke, and let your souls receive
instruction; it is to be found close by.
<br>[<b>27</b>] See with your eyes that I have labored little and found
myself much rest.
<br>[<b>28</b>] Get instruction with a large sum of silver, and you will
gain by it much gold.
<br>[<b>29</b>] May your soul rejoice in his mercy, and may you not be
put to shame when you praise him.
<br>[<b>30</b>] Do your work before the appointed time, and in God's time
he will give you your reward.
