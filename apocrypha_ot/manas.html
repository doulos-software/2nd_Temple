<h3>PrMan.1</h3>
[<b>2</b>] thou who hast made heaven and earth with all their order;
<br>[<b>3</b>] who hast shackled the sea by thy word of command, who hast
confined the deep and sealed it with thy terrible and glorious name;
<br>[<b>4</b>] at whom all things shudder, and tremble before thy power,
<br>[<b>5</b>] for thy glorious splendor cannot be borne, and the wrath
of thy threat to sinners is irresistible;
<br>[<b>6</b>] yet immeasurable and unsearchable is thy promised mercy,
<br>[<b>7</b>] for thou art the Lord Most High, of great compassion, long-suffering,
and very merciful, and repentest over the evils of men. Thou, O Lord, according
to thy great goodness hast promised repentance and forgiveness to those
who have sinned against thee; and in the multitude of thy mercies thou
hast appointed repentance for sinners, that they may be saved.
<br>[<b>8</b>] Therefore thou, O Lord, God of the righteous, hast not appointed
repentance for the righteous, for Abraham and Isaac and Jacob, who did
not sin against thee, but thou hast appointed repentance for me, who am
a sinner.
<br>[<b>9</b>] For the sins I have committed are more in number than the
sand of the sea; my transgressions are multiplied, O Lord, they are multiplied!
I am unworthy to look up and see the height of heaven because of the multitude
of my iniquities.
<br>[<b>10</b>] I am weighted down with many an iron fetter, so that I
am rejected because of my sins, and I have no relief; for I have provoked
thy wrath and have done what is evil in thy sight, setting up abominations
and multiplying offenses.
<br>[<b>11</b>] And now I bend the knee of my heart, beseeching thee for
thy kindness.
<br>[<b>12</b>] I have sinned, O Lord, I have sinned, and I know my transgressions.
<br>[<b>13</b>] I earnestly beseech thee, forgive me, O Lord, forgive me!
Do not destroy me with my transgressions! Do not be angry with me for ever
or lay up evil for me; do not condemn me to the depths of the earth. For
thou, O Lord, art the God of those who repent,
<br>[<b>14</b>] and in me thou wilt manifest thy goodness; for, unworthy
as I am, thou wilt save me in thy great mercy,
<br>[<b>15</b>] and I will praise thee continually all the days of my life.
For all the host of heaven sings thy praise, and thine is the glory for
ever. Amen.
