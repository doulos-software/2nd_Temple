1</h3>
[<b>2</b>] Then Azariah stood and offered this prayer; in the midst of
the fire he opened his mouth and said:
<br>[<b>3</b>] &quot;Blessed art thou, O Lord, God of our fathers, and worthy
of praise; and thy name is glorified for ever.
<br>[<b>4</b>] For thou art just in all that thou hast done to us, and
all thy works are true and thy ways right, and all thy judgments are truth.
<br>[<b>5</b>] Thou hast executed true judgments in all that thou hast
brought upon us and upon Jerusalem, the holy city of our fathers, for in
truth and justice thou hast brought all this upon us because of our sins.
<br>[<b>6</b>] For we have sinfully and lawlessly departed from thee, and
have sinned in all things and have not obeyed thy commandments;
<br>[<b>7</b>] we have not observed them or done them, as thou hast commanded
us that it might go well with us.
<br>[<b>8</b>] So all that thou hast brought upon us, and all that thou
hast done to us, thou hast done in true judgment.
<br>[<b>9</b>] Thou hast given us into the hands of lawless enemies, most
hateful rebels, and to an unjust king, the most wicked in all the world.
<br>[<b>10</b>] And now we cannot open our mouths; shame and disgrace have
befallen thy servants and worshipers.
<br>[<b>11</b>] For thy name's sake do not give us up utterly, and do not
break thy covenant,
<br>[<b>12</b>] and do not withdraw thy mercy from us,
<br>for the sake of Abraham thy beloved and for the sake of Isaac thy servant
and Israel thy holy one,
<br>[<b>13</b>] to whom thou didst promise to make their descendants as
many as the stars of heaven and as the sand on the shore of the sea.
<br>[<b>14</b>] For we, O Lord, have become fewer than any nation, and
are brought low this day in all the world because of our sins.
<br>[<b>15</b>] And at this time there is no prince, or prophet, or leader,
no burnt offering, or sacrifice, or oblation, or incense, no place to make
an offering before thee or to find mercy.
<br>[<b>16</b>] Yet with a contrite heart and a humble spirit may we be
accepted, as though it were with burnt offerings of rams and bulls, and
with tens of thousands of fat lambs;
<br>[<b>17</b>] such may our sacrifice be in thy sight this day, and may
we wholly follow thee, for there will be no shame for those who trust in
thee.
<br>[<b>18</b>] And now with all our heart we follow thee, we fear thee
and seek thy face.
<br>[<b>19</b>] Do not put us to shame, but deal with us in thy forbearance
and in thy abundant mercy.
<br>[<b>20</b>] Deliver us in accordance with thy marvelous works, and
give glory to thy name, O Lord! Let all who do harm to thy servants be
put to shame;
<br>[<b>21</b>] let them be disgraced and deprived of all power and dominion,
and let their strength be broken.
<br>[<b>22</b>] Let them know that thou art the Lord, the only God, glorious
over the whole world.&quot;
<br>[<b>23</b>] Now the king's servants who threw them in did not cease
feeding the furnace fires with naphtha, pitch, tow, and brush.
<br>[<b>24</b>] And the flame streamed out above the furnace forty-nine
cubits,
<br>[<b>25</b>] and it broke through and burned those of the Chaldeans
whom it caught about the furnace.
<br>[<b>26</b>] But the angel of the Lord came down into the furnace to
be with Azariah and his companions, and drove the fiery flame out of the
furnace,
<br>[<b>27</b>] and made the midst of the furnace like a moist whistling
wind, so that the fire did not touch them at all or hurt or trouble them.
<p>[<b>28</b>] Then the three, as with one mouth, praised and glorified
and blessed God in the furnace, saying:
<br>[<b>29</b>] &quot;Blessed art thou, O Lord, God of our fathers, and to be
praised and highly exalted for ever;
<br>[<b>30</b>] And blessed is thy glorious, holy name and to be highly
praised and highly exalted for ever;
<br>[<b>31</b>] Blessed art thou in the temple of thy holy glory and to
be extolled and highly glorified for ever.
<br>[<b>32</b>] Blessed art thou, who sittest upon cherubim and lookest
upon the deeps, and to be praised and highly exalted for ever.
<br>[<b>33</b>] Blessed art thou upon the throne of thy kingdom and to
be extolled and highly exalted for ever.
<br>[<b>34</b>] Blessed art thou in the firmament of heavenand to be sung
and glorified for ever.
<br>[<b>35</b>] &quot;Bless the Lord, all works of the Lord, sing praise to
him and highly exalt him for ever.

<br>[<b>52</b>] Let the earth bless the Lord; let it sing praise to him
and highly exalt him for ever.
<br>[<b>53</b>] Bless the Lord, mountains and hills, sing praise to him
and highly exalt him for ever.
<br>[<b>54</b>] Bless the Lord, all things that grow on the earth, sing

to him and highly exalt him for ever; for he has rescued us from Hades
and saved us from the hand of death, and delivered us from the midst of
the burning fiery furnace; from the midst of the fire he has delivered
us.
<br>[<b>67</b>] Give thanks to the Lord, for he is good, for his mercy
endures for ever.
<br>[<b>68</b>] Bless him, all who worship the Lord, the God of gods, sing
praise to him and give thanks to him, for his mercy endures for ever.&quot;
