  <P>The older testimonies about this book have been given already. I now 
   present the three principal forms of it, as given by Tischendorf: two 
   Greek texts, A and B, and one Latin.

  <P>The few Greek manuscripts are all late. The earliest authorities are a 
   much abbreviated Syriac version of which the manuscript is of the sixth 
   century, and a Latin palimpsest at Vienna of the fifth or sixth century, 
   which has never been deciphered in full.

  <P>The Latin version translated here is found in more manuscripts than the 
   Greek.

      When there was a tumult because search was made by Herod for our Lord Jesus 
      Christ, that he might slay him, then said an angel unto Joseph: Take Mary 
      and her child and flee into Egypt from the face of them that seek to slay 
      him. Now Jesus was two years old when he entered into Egypt. And as he 
      walked through a sown field he put forth his hand and took of the ears and 
      put them upon the fire and ground them and began to eat. <FONT Color="#FF00FF">(And he gave such 
      favour unto that field that year by year when it was sown it yielded unto 
      the lord of it so many measures of wheat as the number of the grains which 
      he had taken from it.)</FONT> Now when they had entered into Egypt they took lodging 
      in the house of a certain widow, and abode in the same place one year. And 
      Jesus became three years old. And seeing boys playing he began to play with 
      them. And he took a dried fish and put it into a basin and commanded it to 
      move to and fro, and it began to move. And again he said to the fish: Cast 
      out thy salt that is in thee and go into the water. And it came to pass. But 
      when the neighbours saw what was done they told it to the widow woman in 
      whose house his mother Mary dwelt. And she when she heard it hasted and cast 
      them out of her house.

     <P><FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">1.</FONT>
      And as Jesus walked with Mary his mother through the midst of the marketplace 
      of the city, he looked about and saw a master teaching his pupils. And behold 
      twelve sparrows which were quarrelling one with another fell from the wall 
      into the lap of the master who taught the boys. And when Jesus saw it he 
      laughed and stood still. 
     <P><FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">2.</FONT>
      Now when that teacher saw him laughing, he said to his pupils in great anger: Go, bring him hither unto me. And when they had brought him, the master took hold on his ear and said: What sawest thou that thou didst laugh? And he said unto him: Master, see, my hand is full of corn, and I shewed it unto them, and scattered the corn, which they are carrying away in danger: for this cause they fought with one another that they might partake of the corn. 3 And Jesus left not the place until it was accomplished. And for this cause the master laboured to cast him out of the city together with his mother.

      And behold, an angel of the Lord met with Mary and said unto her: Take the 
      child and return into the land of the Jews: for they are dead which sought 
      his life. So Mary arose with Jesus, and they went into the city Nazareth, 
      which is in the inheritance of his <FONT Color="#00FF00">(her?)</FONT> father. 
     <P><FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">2.</FONT>
      But when Joseph departed out of Egypt after the death of Herod, he took 
      Jesus into the wilderness until there was quiet in Jerusalem from them that 
      sought the life of the child. And he gave thanks to God for that he had 
      given him understanding, and because he had found grace before the Lord God. 
      Amen.

     <BR>
     <P>or, And Mary arose with Jesus, and they went unto the city of Capernaum 
     which is of Tiberias, unto the inheritance of her father. 
     <P><FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">2.</FONT>
      But when Joseph heard that Jesus was come out of Egypt after the death of 
      Herod, he took him, &c.
      
     <BR>
     <P>or, After these things an angel of the Lord came unto Joseph and unto Mary 
      the mother of Jesus and said unto them: Taketh he child, return into the land 
      of Israel, for they are dead that sought the life of the child. And they 
      arose and went to Nazareth where Joseph possessed the goods of his father. 
     <P><FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">2.</FONT>
      And when Jesus was seven years old, there was quiet in the realm of Herod 
      from all them that sought the life of the child. And they returned unto 
      Bethlehem and abode there.

      being a young child he spake such matters. 
     <BR><FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">2.</FONT>
      And after a few days he came near unto Joseph and said unto him: Thou hast 
      a wise child, and he hath understanding. Come, deliver him to me that he may
      learn letters. And I will teach him with the letters all knowledge and that

     <BR><FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">3.</FONT>
      3 And he told him all the letters from Alpha even to Omega clearly, with

      him: Thou that knowest not the Alpha according to its nature, how canst thou 
      teach others the Beta? thou hypocrite, first, if thou knowest it, teach the 
      Alpha, and then will we believe thee concerning the Beta. Then began he to

      There was therefore a man named Zacheus who heard all that Jesus said unto 
      Joseph, and he marvelled in himself and said: I have never beheld such a 
      child that spake so. And he came near unto Joseph and said to him: Thou hast 
      a wise child: deliver him to me to learn letters, and when he is learned in 
      the study of the letters, I will teach him reverently that he become not 
      foolish. Joseph answered and said unto him: No man is able to teach him but 
      God only. Think you that this young child will be the occasion unto us of 
      little torment, my brother? <FONT Color="#FF00FF">(There should be mention of a cross in this

      But when Jesus heard Joseph saying these things, he said unto Zacheus: 
      Verily, O master, all things that proceed out of my mouth are true. And I am 
      before all men, and I am Lord, but ye are the children of strangers: for unto

      the chief priests nor the doctors nor the Pharisees.

      Jesus answered and said unto them: Wherefore marvel ye? Do ye think it a 
      thing incredible that I have told you the truth? I know when ye were born, 
      and your fathers: and if I should say more unto you, I know when the world 
      was created, and who sent me unto you.
     <P>When the Jews heard the word which the child spake, they were wroth because 
      they were not able to answer him. And the child turned himself about and

      Now when Zacchaeus the teacher heard such and so many allegories of the first

      instruction being so great, and said to them that were there: Woe is me, 
      wretch that I am, I am confounded: I have brought shame to myself by drawing 
      to me this young child.

      Take him away, therefore I beseech thee, my brother Joseph: I cannot endure

      Now Zacchaeus wrote the alphabet in Hebrew, and saith unto him: Alpha. And 
      the young child said: Alpha. And again the master said: Alpha, and the young 
      child likewise. Then again the third time the master said: Alpha. Then Jesus 
      looked upon the teacher and said: Thou that knowest not the Alpha, how canst 
      thou teach another the Beta? And the child beginning at the Alpha said of his 
      own accord the two and twenty letters.

      And thereafter saith he: Hear, O master the ordinance of the first letter, 
      and know how many incomings and lines it hath, and marks, common, going 
      apart, and coming together. And when Zacchaeus heard such designations of the 
      one letter he was amazed and had nothing to answer; and turning about he said 
      unto Joseph: My brother, this child is of a truth not earthly born: take him

      to teach him the letters with sweet speech, and wrote for him the first line

      Then that teacher smote the child on the head and when the child received the

      know the letters which thou wouldest teach me, and I know that ye are unto me 
      as vessels out of which cometh nought but sound, and neither wisdom nor 
      salvation of the soul. And beginning the line he spake all the letters from A 
      even unto T fully with much quickness: and he looked upon the master and 
      said: But thou knowest not how to interpret A and B: how wouldest thou teach 
      others? Thou hypocrite, if thou knowest and canst tell me concerning A, then 
      will I tell thee concerning B. But when the teacher began to expound

      And when the parents of the boy that was dead heard of it they ran weeping, 
      and when they found the boy lying dead upon the earth and Jesus standing 
      alone, they supposed that the boy had been thrown down by him, and they 
      looked upon him and reviled him. 
     <P><FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">3.</FONT>
      But Jesus, seeing that, leaped down straightway from the upper story and 
      stood at the head of him that was dead and saith to him: Zeno, did I cast 
      thee down? Arise and tell. For so was the boy called. And with the word the 
      boy rose up and worshipped Jesus and said: Lord, thou didst not cast me down, 
      but when I was dead thou didst make me alive.

      Now on a day, when Jesus climbed up upon an house with the children, he began 
      to play with them: but one of the boys fell down through the door out of the 
      upper chamber and died straightway. And when the children saw it they fled 
      all of them, but Jesus remained alone in the house. 
     <BR><FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">2.</FONT>
      And when the parents of the child which had died came they spake against 
      Jesus saying: Of a truth thou madest him fall. But Jesus said: I never made 
      him fall: nevertheless they accused him still. Jesus therefore came down from 
      the house and stood over the dead child and cried with a loud voice, calling 
      him by his name: Zeno, Zeno, arise and say if I made thee fall. And on a 
      sudden he arose and said: Nay, Lord. And when his parents saw this great 
      miracle which Jesus did, they glorified God, and worshipped Jesus.

      And after these things, in the neighbourhood of Joseph, a little child fell 
      sick and died, and his mother wept sore. And Jesus heard that there was 
      great mourning and trouble and he ran quickly and found the child dead: and 
      he touched his breast and said: I say unto thee, Child, die not, but live and 
      be with thy mother. And straightway it looked up and laughed. And he said to 
      the woman: Take him up and give him milk, and remember me.

      And the multitude that stood by saw it and marvelled, and said: Of a truth 
      this young child is either a god or an angel of God; for every word of his 
      is a perfect work. And Jesus departed thence, and was playing with other 
      children.

      After a few days a child that was his neighbour died, and his mother mourned 
      for him sore; and when Jesus heard, he went and stood over the child, and 
      smote him on the breast and said: Child, I say unto thee, die not, but live. 
      And immediately the child arose: and Jesus said unto the mother of the child: 
      Take up thy son and give him suck, and remember me.

      But the multitudes when they saw that miracle said: Of a truth this child is 
      from heaven, for now hath he set free many souls from death and hath saved 
      all them that hoped in him.

      And after some time there was work of building. And there came a great tumult, 
      and Jesus arose and went thither: and he saw a man lying dead, and took hold 
      of his hand and said: Man, I say unto thee, arise and do thy work. And 
      immediately he arose and worshipped him.

      And when he was twelve years old his parents went according to the custom 
      unto Jerusalem to the feast of the passover with their company: and after 
      the passover they returned to go unto their house. And as they returned the 
      child Jesus went back to Jerusalem; but his parents supposed that he was in 
      their company.

      And when they had gone a day's journey, they sought him among their kinsfolk, 
      and when they found him not, they were troubled, and returned again to the 
      city seeking him. And after the third day they found him in the temple 
      sitting in the midst of the doctors and hearing and asking them questions. 
      And all men paid heed to him and marvelled how that being a young child he 
      put to silence the elders and teachers of the people, expounding the heads 
      of the law and the parables of the prophets.

      And his mother Mary came near and said unto him: Child, wherefore hast thou 
      so done unto us? behold we have sought thee sorrowing. And Jesus said unto 
      them: Why seek ye me? know ye not that I must be in my Father's house?
