<center><b>THE APOSTLES' CREED</b></center>
<HR>

<p>[It is affirmed by Ambrose, &quot;that the twelve Apostles, as skilful artificers
assembled together, and made a key by their common advice, that is, the
Creed; by which the darkness of the devil is disclosed, that the light
of Christ may appear.&quot; Others fable that every Apostle inserted an article,
by which the creed is divided into twelve articles; and a sermon, fathered
upon St. Austin, and quoted by the Lord Chancellor King, fabricates that
each particular article was thus inserted by each particular Apostle:-

<p>Archbishop Wake says: &quot;With respect to the Apostles being the authors
of this Creed, it is not my intention to enter on any particular examination
of this matter, which has been so fully handled, not only by the late critics
of the Church of Rome, Natalis Alexander, Du Pin, &amp;c., but yet more
especially by Archbishop Usher, Gerard Vossius,Suicer, Spanhemius, Tentzelius,
and Sam.
<p>Basnage, among the Protestants. It shall suffice to say, that as it
is not likely, that had any such thing as this been done by the Apostles,
St. Luke would have passed it by, without taking the least notice of it:
so the diversity of Creeds in the ancient Church, and that not only in
expression, but in some whole Articles too, sufficiently shows, that the
Creed which we call by that name, was not composed by the twelve Apostles,
much less in the same form in which it now is.&quot;
<p>Mr. Justice Bailey says: &quot;It is not to be understood that this Creed
was framed by the Apostles, or indeed that it existed as a Creed in their
time;&quot; and after giving the Creed as it existed in the year 600, and which
is here copied from his Common Prayer Book, he says, &quot;how long this form
had existed before the year 600 is not exactly known. The additions were
probably made in opposition to particular heresies and errors.'
<p>The most important &quot;addition,&quot; since the year of Christ 600, is that
which affirms, that Christ
<br>descended into hell. This has been proved not only to have been an
invention after the Apostles' time, but even after the time of Eusebius.
Bishop Pearson says, that the descent into hell was not in the ancient
creeds or rules of faith. &quot;It is not to be found in the rules of faith
delivered by Irenaeus,&quot; by Origen, or by Tertullian.
<p>It is not expressed in those creeds which were made by the councils
as larger explications of the Apostles' Creed; not in the Nicene, or Constantinopolitan;
not in those of Ephesus, or Chalcedon; not in those confessions made at
Sardica, Antioch, Selucia, Sirmium, &amp;c. It is not mentioned in several
confessions of faith delivered by particular persons; not in that of Eusebius
Caesariensis, presented to the council of Nice; not in that of Marcellus,
bishop of Ancyra, delivered to Pope Julius; not in that of Arius and Euzoius,
presented to Constantine; not in that of Acacius, bishop of Caesarea, delivered
into the synod of Selucia; not in that of Eustathius, Theophilus, and Sylvanus,
sent to Liberius; there is no mention of it in the creed of St. Basil;
in the creed of Epiphanus, Gelasius, Damascus, Macarius, &amp;c.
<p>It is not in the creed expounded by St. Cyril, though some have produced
that creed to prove it.
<br>It is not in the creed expounded by St. Augustine; not in that other,
attributed to St. Augustine in another place; not in that expounded by
Maximus Taurinensis; nor in that so often interpreted by Petrus Chrysologus;
nor in that of the church of Antioch, delivered by Cassianus; neither is
it to be seen in the MS. creeds set forth by the learned Archbishop of
Armagh. It is affirmed by Ruffinus, that in his time it was neither in
the Roman nor the Oriental Creeds.&quot;
