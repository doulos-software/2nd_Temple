<P align=center>by Tertullian 
<P>
<P align=center>Chapter 1 
<P>
<P>Jesus Christ our Lord the Spirit of God and the Word of God and the Reason of 
God--the Word (which expresses) the Reason, and the Reason (which possesses) the 
Word, and the Spirit of both--has prescribed for His new disciples of the New 
Testament a new form of prayer. For in this matter, also, it was fitting that 
new wine be stored in new wine skins and that a new patch be sewed upon a new 
garment. Whatever had prevailed in days gone by was either abolished, like 
circumcision, or completed, like the rest of the Law, or fulfilled, like the 
prophecies, or brought to its perfection, like faith itself. 
<P>Everything has been changed from carnal to spiritual by the new grace of God 
which, with the coming of the Gospel, has wiped out the old completely; and in 
this grace it has been proved there is the Spirit of God and the Word of God and 
the Reason of God, Jesus Christ our Lord; as the Spirit wherein He prevailed, 
the Word whereby He taught, and the Reason &nbsp;or which He came. Consequently, 
the prayer formulated by Christ consists of three elements: the spirit whereby 
it can have such power, the word by which it is expressed, and the reason why it 
produces reconciliation. 
<P>John, too, had taught his disciples to pray, but everything that John did was 
a preparation for Christ, until He would &nbsp;increase--even as John himself 
announced that He (Christ) must increase, but he himself must decrease--and the 
entire work of the servant would pass over, along with the spirit itself, to the 
Master. Hence it is that the words in which John taught men to offer their 
prayer are not extant, for the earthly have given place to the heavenly. 'He who 
is from the earth,' He says, 'of the earth speaks, and he who comes from heaven 
bears witness to that which he has seen.' And what that is of Christ the Lord is 
not of heaven, as is also this instruction concerning prayer? 
<P>Let us then, my blessed ones, consider His heavenly wisdom, in the first 
place with regard to the admonition to pray in secret. By this, He demanded of 
man the faith to believe that he is seen and heard by Almighty God even when he 
is within the house and out of sight; and He desired a modest reserve in the 
manifestation of his faith so that he would offer his homage to God alone who he 
believed was listening and observing everywhere. 
<P>The next recommendation in the following precept would, then, pertain to 
faith and the proper display of faith; we should not think that the Lord is to 
be approached with a barrage of words since we are certain that of His own 
accord He has regard for His creatures. 
<P>Yet, that concise phrase which forms the third point of His teaching rests 
for support upon a profound and effective figure of speech: the thought 
compressed within such few words carries a flood of meaning to the mind. For not 
only does it embrace the proper duties of prayer, namely, worship of God and 
man's act of supplication, but practically every word of the Lord, the whole 
content of His teaching, so that, really, in (the Lord's) Prayer, there is 
contained an abridgment of the entire Gospel. 
<P>
<P align=center>Chapter 2 
<P>
<P>It begins with a proof of (our belief in) God and a meritorious act of faith 
when we say, 'Father, who art in heaven.' For we adore God and prove our faith, 
of which this form of address is the result. It is written: 'To them that 
believe in God He gave the power to be called the sons of God.' 
<P>Our Lord very frequently spoke to us of God as a Father; in fact, He even 
taught us to call none on earth 'father,' but only the one we have in heaven. 
Therefore, when we pray like this we are observing this precept, too. 
<P>Happy they who know the Father! This is the reproach made against Israel, 
when the Spirit calls heaven and earth to witness saying: 'I have begotten sons 
and they have not known me.' 
<P>Moreover, when we say 'Father,' we also add a title to God's name. This form 
of address is one of filial love and at the same time one of power. 
<P>In the Father, the Son is also addressed. For Christ said, 'I and the Father 
are one.' 
<P>Nor is Mother Church passed over without mention, for in the Son and the 
Father the Mother is recognized, since upon her the terms 'Father' and 'Son' 
depend for their meaning. &nbsp; With this one form, then, or word, we honor God 
with His own, we heed His precept, and we reproach those who are unmindful of 
the Father. 
<P>
<P align=center>Chapter 3 
<P>
<P>The title 'God the Father' had not been revealed to anyone. Even Moses who 
had inquired about God's name had heard a different one. It has been revealed to 
us in His Son. For, before the Son (came) the name of the Father did not exist. 
'I have come,' said Christ, 'in the name of my Father.' And again: 'Father, 
glorify thy name.' And, more explicitly: 'I have manifested thy name to men.' 
<P>We ask that this name be hallowed; not that it would be the proper thing for 
men to wish God well as if He were (just) another man and we could express some 
wish in his regard; or as if it would hurt Him if we did not express the wish. 
Certainly it is right that God should be blessed in all places and at all times 
because it is every man's duty to be ever mindful of His benefits, but this wish 
takes the form of a benediction. 
<P>Moreover, when is the name of God not holy and blessed in itself, when of 
itself it makes others holy? To Him the attending hosts of angels cease not to 
say: 'Holy, holy, holy!' Therefore, we, too--the future comrades of the angels, 
if we earn this reward--become familiar even while here on this earth with that 
heavenly cry of praise to God and the duty of our future glory. 
<P>So much for the glory we give to God. Over and above that, there is reference 
to our own petition when we say 'Hallowed be thy name.' We are asking that it be 
sanctified in us who are in Him, as well as in all other men for whom the grace 
of God is still waiting. In this, too, we obey the precept by praying for all 
men, even our enemies. And thus, by an ellipsis, we say, not: 'May Thy name be 
hallowed among us,' but, we say: 'Among all men.' 
<P>
<P align=center>Chapter 4 
<P>
<P>Next, we add this phrase: 'Thy will be done in heaven and on earth.' Not that 
anyone could prevent the fulfillment of God's will and we should pray that His 
will be successfully accomplished, but we pray that in everything His will may 
be done. For, by a figure of speech, under the symbol of flesh and spirit we 
represent heaven and earth. 
<P>But, even if this is to be understood literally, the sense of the petition is 
the same, namely, that the will of God be done in us on earth, in order that it 
may be done (by us) also in heaven. Now, what does God will but that we walk 
according to His teaching? We ask, therefore, that He grant us the substance and 
riches of His will, for our salvation both in heaven and on earth, since the sum 
total of His will is the salvation of those whom He has adopted as His children. 

<P>This is the will of God which our Lord accomplished by His teaching, His 
works, and His sufferings. For, if He Himself said that He did not His own will, 
but the will of His Father, without a doubt what He did was the will of His 
Father, to which we are now summoned as to a model, that we, too, may teach and 
work and suffer even unto death. That we may accomplish this there is need of 
God's will. 
<P>Likewise, when we say: 'Thy will be done,' we thereby wish well to ourselves 
because there is no evil in God's will, even if some adversity be inflicted upon 
one according to his deserts. 
<P>Now, by this phrase we forearm ourselves for patient endurance since our 
Lord, too, willed to point out in His own flesh under the intensity of His 
Passion the weakness of the flesh. 'Father,' He said, 'remove this cup from Me,' 
and then, after reflection, He added: 'Yet not my will but thine be done.' He 
Himself was the will and power of the Father, yet He surrendered Himself to the 
will of His Father to indicate the patient endurance which is rightly due. 
<P>
<P align=center>Chapter 5 
<P>
<P>The phrase, 'Thy kingdom come,' also refers to the same end as 'Thy will be 
done,' namely, (May Thy kingdom come) in ourselves. For, when does God not 
reign, 'in whose hand is the heart of every king'? But, whatever we wish for 
ourselves, we direct our hope toward Him, and we attribute to Him what we expect 
from Him. Well, then, if the realization of our Lord's kingdom has reference to 
the will of God and to our uncertain condition, how is it that some ask for an 
extension of time, as it were, for this world, since the kingdom of God--for the 
coming of which we pray--tends toward the consummation of the world? Our hope is 
that we may sooner reign, and not be slaves any longer. 
<P>Even if it were not prescribed to ask in prayer for the coming of His 
kingdom, we would, of our own accord, have expressed this desire in our 
eagerness to embrace the object of our hope. 
<P>With indignation the souls of the martyrs beneath the altar cry aloud to the 
Lord: 'How long, O Lord, dost thou refrain from avenging our blood on those who 
dwell on the earth?' For, at least from the end of the world vengeance for them 
is ordained. 
<P>Indeed, as quickly as possible, O Lord, may Thy kingdom come! This is the 
prayer of Christians; this shall bring shame to the heathens; this shall bring 
joy to the angels; it is for the coming of this kingdom that we are harassed 
now, or rather, it is for this coming that we pray. 
<P>
<P align=center>Chapter 6 
<P>
<P>With what exquisite choice has divine Wisdom arranged the order of this 
prayer that, after the matters which pertain to heaven--that is, after the name 
of God, the will of God, and the kingdom of God--it should make a place for a 
petition for our earthly needs, too! For our Lord has taught us: 'Seek first the 
kingdom, and then these things shall be given you besides.' 
<P>However, we should rather understand 'Give us this day our daily bread' in a 
spiritual sense. For Christ is 'our bread,' because Christ is Life and the Life 
is Bread. 'I am,' said He, 'the bread of life.' And shortly before: 'The bread 
is the word of the living God who hath come down from heaven.' Then, because His 
Body is considered to be in the bread: 'This is my body.' Therefore, when we ask 
for our daily bread, we are asking to live forever in Christ and to be 
inseparably united with His Body. 
<P>But, since there is admitted also an interpretation of this phrase according 
to the flesh, it cannot be devoid of religious sense and spiritual instruction. 
Christ commands that we ask for bread, which, for the faithful, is the only 
thing necessary, for the pagans seek all other things. Thus, too, He impresses 
His teaching by examples and He instructs by parables, saying, for example: 
'Does a father take bread from his children and cast it to the dogs?' And again: 
'If his son asks him for a loaf, will he hand him a stone?' He indicates what 
children expect from their father. That caller, too, who knocked upon the door 
in the night was asking for bread. 
<P>Moreover, He has rightly added: 'Give us this day' in view of what He had 
previously said: 'Do not be anxious about tomorrow, what you shall eat.' To this 
idea He also referred in the parable of that man who, when his crops were 
plentiful, laid plans for an addition to his barns and a long-range program of 
security--though he was destined to die that very night. 
<P>
<P align=center>Chapter 7 
<P>
<P>&nbsp;Having considered God's generosity, we pray next for His indulgence. 
&nbsp;For, of what benefit is food if, in reality, we are bent on it like a bull 
on his victim? Our Lord knew that He alone was without sin. Therefore, He taught 
us to say in prayer: 'Forgive us our trespasses.' A prayer for pardon is an 
acknowledgment of sin, since one who asks for pardon confesses his guilt. Thus, 
too, repentance is shown to be acceptable to God, because God wills this rather 
than the death of the sinner. 
<P>Now, in Scripture, 'debt' is used figuratively to mean sin, because of this 
analogy: When a man owes something to a judge and payment is exacted from him, 
he does not escape the just demand unless excused from the payment of the debt, 
just as the master forgave the debt to that servant. &nbsp;Now, this is the 
point of the whole parable: Just as the servant was freed by his lord, but 
failed in turn to be merciful to his debtor and therefore, when brought before 
his lord, was handed over to the torturer until he paid the last penny, that is, 
the least and last of his faults, (Christ) intended by this parable to get us, 
also, to forgive our debtors. 
<P>This is expressed elsewhere under this aspect of prayer; 'Forgive,' He said, 
'and you shall be forgiven.' And when Peter asked if one should forgive his 
brother seven times, our Lord said, 'Rather, seventy times seven times,' that He 
might improve upon the Law, for in Genesis vengeance was demanded of Cain seven 
times, of Lamech seventy times seven. 
<P>
<P align=center>Chapter 8 
<P>
<P>To complete the prayer which was so well arranged, Christ added that we 
should pray not only that our sins be forgiven, but that they be shunned 
completely: 'Lead us not into temptation,' that is, do not allow us to be led by 
the Tempter. 
<P>God forbid that our Lord should seem to be the tempter, as if He were not 
aware of one's faith or were eager to upset it! 
<P>That weakness and spitefulness belongs to the Devil. For, even in the case of 
Abraham, God had ordered the sacrifice of his son not to tempt his faith, but to 
prove it, that in him He-might set forth an example for His precept whereby He 
was later to teach that no one should hold his loved ones dearer than God. 
<P>Christ Himself was tempted by the Devil and pointed out the subtle director 
of the temptation. 
<P>This passage He confirms (by His words to His Apostles) later when He says: 
'Pray that you may not enter into temptation.' They were so tempted to desert 
their Lord because they had indulged in sleep instead of prayer. 
<P>Therefore, the phrase which balances and interprets 'Lead us not into 
temptation' is 'But deliver us from evil.' 
<P>
<P align=center>Chapter 9 
<P>
<P>How many utterances of the Prophets, Evangelists, and Apostles; how many of 
our Lord's sermons, parables, examples, and precepts are touched in the brief 
compass of a few little words! How many duties are fulfilled! 
<P>The honor due to God in the word 'Father'; a testimony of faith in the very 
title used; the offering of obedience in the mention of God's will; the 
remembrance of hope in the mention of His kingdom; a petition for life in the 
mention of bread; the confession of sins in asking for pardon; solicitude 
regarding temptation in the request for protection. 
<P>Yet, why be surprised? God alone could teach us how He would have us pray. 
The homage of prayer, then, as arranged by Him and animated by His Spirit at the 
very moment it went forth from His divine lips, because of the prerogative 
granted to Him, ascends to heaven, recommending to the Father what the Son has 
taught. 
<P>
<P align=center>Chapter 10 
<P>
<P>Since, however, our Lord, who saw the needs of men, after giving them the 
method of prayer, said: 'Ask and you shall receive,' and since every man has 
petitions to make according to his own circumstances, everyone first sends ahead 
the prescribed and customary prayer which will, so to speak, lay the ground work 
for his additional desires. He then has the right to heap upon this 
(substructure) petitions, over and above--ever keeping in mind, however, the 
prescribed conditions, that we may be no farther from the ears of God than from 
His teachings. 
<P>
<P align=center>Chapter 11 
<P>
<P>The remembrance of these teachings paves the way for our prayers to reach 
heaven, and the first of these is not to approach the altar of God without 
settling any controversy or quarrel we may have contracted with our brethren. 
For, how can one approach the peace of God without peace, or the forgiveness of 
sin when he nurses a grudge? How will he please his Father if he be angry with 
his brother, when all anger has been forbidden us from the beginning? 
<P>For Joseph, sending his brothers home to bring their father, said: 'Do not 
quarrel on the way!' He was, in fact, admonishing us--for elsewhere our manner 
of life is called our 'way'--that on the way of prayer that has been set up we 
must not approach the Father if we are angry. &nbsp; 
<P>Furthermore, our Lord, clearly enlarging upon the Law, adds anger with one's 
brother to the sin of murder. He does not permit even an evil word to be 
expressed; even if one must experience anger, it should not outlast the setting 
of the sun, as the Apostle reminds us. How foolhardy it is, moreover, either to 
pass a day without prayer, while you fail to give satisfaction to your brother, 
or to pray to no avail since your anger persists! 
<P>
<P align=center>Chapter 12 
<P>
<P>Since the attention of our prayer is bestowed by and directed to the same 
Spirit, it should be free not only from anger, but from any and every 
disturbance of the mind. For the Holy Spirit does not acknowledge an impure 
spirit, neither is a sad spirit recognized by the Spirit of Joy, nor a spirit 
that is bound by one that is free. No one extends a welcoming hand to an 
opponent; no one admits another unless he is a kindred spirit. 
<P>
<P align=center>Chapter 13 
<P>
<P>Furthermore, what is the sense of approaching prayer with hands that have 
been cleansed but with a spirit that is stained? Why, even the hands themselves 
need a spiritual cleansing that they may be raised to heaven cleansed of 
falsehood, murder, cruelty, poisoning, idolatry, and all other stains which, 
conceived in the spirit, are accomplished by the operation of the hands. This is 
the real cleansing, not the kind which many, in superstitious anxiety, attend 
to, taking water at every prayer, even when they come after a complete bath! 
<P>When I pondered this in detail and sought an explanation, I found it told of 
Pilate that he washed his hands in the act of surrendering Christ. &nbsp;We 
adore Christ, we do not surrender Him. Surely, we ought rather to follow a 
course of conduct different from that of the traitor and for that very reason 
not wash our hands; except to wash them because of some stain resulting from our 
dealings with men, for our conscience's sake; but the hands are sufficiently 
clean which we have washed once and for all, together with the whole body, in 
Christ. 
<P>
<P align=center>Chapter 14 
<P>
<P>Though Israel may wash all its members every day, it is never clean. Its 
hands, at least, are always stained, forever red with the blood of the Prophets 
and of our Lord Himself. Conscious, therefore, of this hereditary stain of their 
fathers, they do not dare to raise their hands to the Lord, lest some Isaias cry 
out, lest Christ abominate them. In our case, not only do we raise them, we even 
spread them out, and, imitating the Passion of our Lord, we confess Christ as we 
pray. 
<P>
<P align=center>Chapter 15 
<P>
<P>Now, since we have mentioned one detail of religious observance that is 
foolish, we shall not be loathe to censure the others, too, in which vanity 
deserves to be reproved, inasmuch as they are without the authority of any 
precept, either on the part of our Lord or any of the Apostles. Practices such 
as this are to be considered superstition rather than devout homage; affected 
and forced and indicative of scrupulosity rather than of a rational service; at 
any rate, constrained to match those of the pagans. 
<P>Take, for example, the practice some have of laying aside their cloaks when 
they pray. This is the way pagans approach their idols. Now certainly, if this 
were necessary, the Apostles would have included it in their instructions about 
the dress for prayer; unless there are some who think that it was during his 
prayer that Paul left his cloak with Carpus! I suppose that the God who heeded 
the prayer of the three holy youths in the furnace of the Babylonian king when 
they prayed in their wide oriental trousers and turbans would not listen to 
those who wear their cloaks during prayer! 
<P>
<P align=center>Chapter 16 
<P>
<P>Similarly, regarding the custom some have of sitting down when their prayer 
is ended: I see no reason for it except that they are acting like children. What 
do I mean? If that Hermas, whose writings generally bear the title 'The 
Shepherd,' had not sat upon his bed when his prayer was finished, but had done 
something else, would we adopt this practice, too? &nbsp;Certainly not! 
<P>For the phrase, 'When I had offered my prayer and had seated myself on the 
bed,' was set down simply and solely in the course of the narrative, not as a 
point of discipline. 
<P>Otherwise, we would not be obliged to offer prayers anywhere except where 
there was a bed! 
<P>On the other hand, it would be violating his directions to sit upon a chair 
or bench! 
<P>Furthermore, since this is what the pagans do--sit down before the images of 
the gods which they adore--it is on this score that what is done before idols 
deserves to be reproved in us. 
<P>For this reason it is set down as a charge of irreverence, and would be so 
understood, even by those pagans, if they had any understanding. For, if it is 
disrespectful to sit down in the presence and sight of one whom you hold in very 
high esteem and honor, how much more is it the height of disrespect to do so in 
the presence of the living God with the angel of prayer standing beside Him? 
Unless we are offering a reproach to God because our prayer has wearied us! 
<P>
<P align=center>Chapter 17 
<P>
<P>On the other hand, when we offer our prayer with modesty and humility, we 
commend our petitions to God all the more, even though our hands have not been 
raised very high in the air, but only slightly and to a proper position, and 
even though our gaze has not been lifted up in presumption. 
<P>For, even the publican who, not only in his words but in his countenance as 
well, was humble and prayed with downcast eyes went away justified rather than 
the haughty Pharisee. 
<P>The tone of voice, too, should be lowered; otherwise, what lungs we will 
need, if being heard depended upon the noise we make! But God is not one who 
heeds the voice; rather, it is the heart which He hears and beholds. 
<P>'Even the speechless I hear, and the silent petition I answer.' So runs an 
oracle of the Pythian demon. Do the ears of God await a sound? If they did, how 
could Jonas' prayer from the depths of the whale's belly have made its way to 
heaven, up through the organs of such a great beast from the very bottom of the 
sea, up through such a vast amount of water? 
<P>As for those who pray in such a loud voice, what else will they attain but 
the annoyance of their neighbors? Let us say, rather, when they thus publicize 
their petitions, what else are they doing but praying in public? 
<P>
<P align=center>Chapter 18 
<P>
<P>There is another custom which has now become established: when those who are 
fasting have finished their prayer with their brethren, they withhold the kiss 
of peace; yet this is the seal of prayer. 
<P>But, when is the kiss of peace to be given to our brethren if not when our 
prayer ascends to heaven, made more worthy of praise because of our charity? So 
that they themselves may share in our charity, who have contributed to it by 
passing on their peace to their brother. 
<P>What prayer is complete without the bond of a holy kiss? 
<P>With whom does the kiss of peace interfere in his service of the Lord? 
<P>What kind of sacrifice is it from which one departs without giving the kiss 
of peace? 
<P>Whatever the reason may be, it will not outweigh the observance of the 
precept whereby we are bidden to conceal our fasting. For, when we refrain from 
the kiss, it is recognized that we are fasting. But, even if there is some 
reason for it, still, that you may not be guilty of transgressing this precept, 
you may, if you wish, dispense with the kiss of peace at home, since there you 
are among those from whom it is not entirely possible to conceal your fasting. 
But, wherever else you can conceal your acts of mortification, you ought to 
remember this precept; in this way you will satisfactorily comply with religious 
discipline in public, and with ordinary usage at home. 
<P>Thus, too, on Good Friday, when the fasting is a general and, as it were, a 
public religious obligation, we rightly omit the kiss of peace, having no 
anxiety about concealing that which we are doing along with everyone else. 
<P>
<P align=center>Chapter 19 
<P>
<P>Similarly, with regard to the station days, many do not think that there 
should be any attendance at the prayers of sacrifice, because the station should 
be ended when the Lord's Body is received. 
<P>Has the Eucharist, then, dispensed with a duty vowed to God, or does it place 
upon us a greater obligation to God? 
<P>Will not your station be more solemn if you stand at the altar of God? 
<P>When the Body of our Lord is received and reserved, both are preserved: the 
participation in the sacrifice and the fulfillment of a duty. 
<P>Since 'station' has taken its name from military procedure (for we are God's 
militia), certainly no joy nor sadness which befalls the camp releases the 
soldiers on guard duty. For, in joy one will perform his duty more readily, and, 
in sadness, more conscientiously. 
<P>
<P align=center>Chapter 20 
<P>
<P>As regards dress--I refer only to that of women--the difference of custom 
since the time of the holy Apostle has caused me, though a man of no rank (in 
the Church), to deal with this matter, which is a daring thing to do; except 
that it is not so daring if we deal with it as did the Apostle. 
<P>As for the modesty of their attire and adornment, the admonition of Peter, 
too, is clearly expressed. Using the same words as Paul, because inspired by the 
same Spirit, he imposes restraint regarding ostentation in their dress, the 
proud display of gold, and the overcareful, meretricious arrangement of their 
hair. 
<P>
<P align=center>Chapter 21 
<P>
<P>A point which must be treated, since in general, throughout the Church, it is 
regarded as a matter of dispute, is the question of whether or not virgins 
should be veiled. 
<P>Those who grant to virgins the right of having their heads uncovered seem to 
support their position by the fact that the Apostle designated specifically, not 
that virgins, but that women, are to be veiled; that is, he referred not to the 
sex, using the generic term 'females,' but to one group within the sex, saying 
'women.' 
<P>For, if he had specified the (entire) sex by the term 'females' he would have 
laid down an absolute law relating to every woman; but since he designates one 
group within the sex, he sets it apart by his silence regarding another group. 
<P>For, they say, he could have included them in the general term 'females.' 
<P>
<P align=center>Chapter 22 
<P>
<P>Those who take this stand ought to give some thought to the basic meaning of 
this word. What does 'woman' mean right from the first pages of holy Scripture? 
They will discover that it is the term used to designate the sex, not a group 
within the sex; for God called Eve, although she had not yet known man, both 
woman and female: female, as an over-all term for the sex; woman, with special 
reference to a stage of life within the sex. &nbsp;Thus, since Eve, who up to 
that time was still unmarried, was designated by the term 'woman,' this term 
came to be commonly applied to a virgin, also. &nbsp;No wonder, then, if the 
Apostle, actuated by the same Spirit which has inspired all the sacred 
Scriptures as well as that Book of Genesis, used this same word, 'woman,' which, 
because of its application to the unmarried Eve, means also a virgin. 
<P>Everything else, then, is in agreement. For, by the very fact that he has not 
named virgins, just as is the case in another passage, where he is teaching 
about marriage, he makes it clear that he is speaking about all women and the 
entire sex and that there is no distinction between a woman and a virgin since 
he does not mention the latter at all. For, since he did not forget to make a 
distinction in another passage where the difference demands it (he distinguishes 
both classes by designating each with its proper term), in a passage where he 
does not distinguish, since he does not name each, he does not intend any 
distinction. 
<P>But what of the fact that in the Greek, in which the Apostle wrote his 
epistles, the ordinary usage is to speak of 'women' rather than 'females,' that 
is, y~*va;KaS rather than ~as? Well, if this word is the one commonly used to 
designate the sex, then the Apostle, in saying yuvalKa, referred to the (entire) 
sex (by using) a word which, in translation, means 'females.' But in the 
(entire) sex the virgin, too, is included. 
<P>The form of expression is unmistakable: 'Every woman,' he says, 'praying or 
prophesying with her head uncovered disgraces her head.' What is the meaning of 
the expression 'every woman' except women of every age, every rank, and every 
circumstance? In saying 'every,' he excepts no member of the female sex, even as 
he does not command that men should have their heads covered. For then he would 
say 'every man.' Therefore, as in the reference to the male sex, under the term 
'man' he forbids that even unmarried men should have their heads covered, 
similarly, in reference to the female sex, under the term 'woman' he commands 
that even a virgin should have her head covered. Without discrimination, in the 
case of both sexes, the younger should follow the rule for the elder; or else 
unmarried men should have their heads covered, too, if unmarried women should 
not have their heads covered; for the former are not specifically named in the 
regulation; let the (married) man be different from the unmarried if the woman 
is different from the virgin. 
<P>Of course, it is on account of the angels, he says, that the woman's head is 
to be covered, because the angels revolted from God on account of the daughters 
of men. Who, then, would contend that it is only women, that is, married women 
no longer virgins, that are a source of temptation? 
<P>Unless, of course, unmarried women may not present an attractive appearance 
and find their lovers? Rather, let us see whether it was virgins alone whom they 
desired when Scripture speaks of the 'daughters of men'; for it could have used 
the terms 'men's wives' or 'women' indifferently. 
<P>But, since it says: 'And they took to themselves wives,' it does so because 
they took as their wives those without husbands. Scripture would have used a 
different expression for those who had husbands. Now, they could be without 
husbands either because they were widows or virgins. So, in naming the sex in 
general by the term 'daughters,' he embraced species in genus. 
<P>Likewise, when he says that nature itself teaches that women should cover 
their heads because it has bestowed hair on woman both as a covering and an 
adornment, has not this same covering and this same adornment for the head been 
bestowed upon virgins as well? If it is a disgrace for a woman to have her hair 
shorn, it is for a virgin then, also. 
<P>Since, then, one and the same condition is attributed to each in regard to 
the head, then one and the same regulation regarding the head is imposed upon 
them--even upon those virgins whom their tender age protects. For, right from 
the start she is included in the term 'woman.' Finally, Israel has the same 
regulation. But even if it did not, our law, amplified and supplemented, would 
demand an addition, imposing a veil upon virgins, also. Granted that at the 
moment that period of life which is unaware of its own sex should be excused. 
(Granted that it should retain the privilege of its innocence; for both Eve and 
Adam, when realization came to them, immediately covered what they had come to 
know.) At any rate, in the case of those who have left childhood, their age 
ought to confer much both by way of nature and of discipline. For women are 
revealed by their members and their duties. No one is a virgin from the time she 
is of marriageable age, since the age now in her has become the bride of its own 
partner, that is, time. 
<P>'But (suppose that) someone has consecrated herself to God.' Nevertheless, 
from this time on, she rearranges her hair and changes her whole appearance to 
that of a woman. Therefore, let her be earnest about the whole business and 
present the complete appearance of a virgin; what she conceals for God's sake 
let her keep completely out of sight. It is to our interest to entrust to the 
knowledge of God alone what is done for the sake of God, lest we bargain with 
men for what we hope to receive from God. Why do you expose before the eyes of 
God what you cover in the presence of men? Will you be more modest in the public 
street than in church? If it is a gift from God and 'thou hast received it, why 
dost thou boast,' says the Apostle, 'as if thou hadst not received it?' Why do 
you condemn other women by this exhibition of yourself? Or are you inviting 
others to good by your vanity? Yet you are in danger of losing it yourself if 
you boast of it, and you force others to the same dangers. That is easily 
destroyed which is assumed with an inclination to vanity. Virgin, cover your 
head if you are a virgin, for you ought to blush for shame! If you are a virgin, 
avoid the gaze of many eyes. Let no one look in admiration upon your face. Let 
no one realize your deceit. It is praiseworthy for you to create the false 
impression that you are married by covering your head. Rather, it will not be a 
false impression you are creating; for you are the bride of Christ. To Him you 
have surrendered your body; act according to the instructions of your Spouse. If 
He bids other men's brides to cover their heads, how much more His own! 
<P>'But (suppose that) someone thinks the arrangement of his predecessor should 
not be changed.' Many apply their own ideas and persistence in the same to the 
custom established by another. Granted that virgins should not be forced to 
cover their heads; at any rate, those who are willing to do so should not be 
prevented. If some cannot deny that they are virgins, they should be content, 
for the sake of preserving their conscience before God, to risk their 
reputation. &nbsp;However, in regard to those who are betrothed, I can declare 
and avow this with more than my usual firmness: their heads should be covered 
from the day when they first trembled at the kiss and handclasp of their future 
husband. For, in these symbols they have pledged every bit of themselves--their 
life throughout its full development, their flesh throughout their lifetime, 
their spirit through their understanding (of the contract), their modesty 
through the exchange of a kiss, their hope through their expectation, and their 
mind through their willingness. For us, Rebecca &nbsp;stands as sufficient 
example; when her future husband had been pointed out to her, she covered her 
head with her veil merely because she knew she was to marry him. 
<P>
<P align=center>Chapter 23 
<P>
<P>With regard to kneeling, too, prayer allows a difference in custom because of 
certain ones--a very few--who stay off their knees on the Sabbath, an opposing 
point of view which is just now strongly defending itself in the churches. 
<P>The Lord will give His grace so that either they will yield, or else maintain 
their own opinion without giving scandal to others. As for ourselves, according 
to our tradition, only on the day (which commemorates) our Lord's Resurrection 
should we refrain from this custom; and not only from this, but from every sign 
that bespeaks solicitude and every ceremony arising therefrom. This includes 
deferring business, lest we give any opportunity to the Devil. The same holds 
for the season of &nbsp;Pentecost, which is marked by the same joyous 
celebration. 
<P>But who would hesitate every day to prostrate himself before God for at least 
the first prayer with which we approach the light of day? 
<P>Moreover, during the periods of fasting and on the station days no prayer 
should be said except on the knees and with every other sign of a humble spirit. 
For we are not merely praying, but beseeching and offering satisfaction to God 
our Lord. 
<P>
<P align=center>Chapter 24 
<P>
<P>Regarding the time for prayer there has been no regulation at all, except 
that we are to pray at all times and everywhere. But how can we pray everywhere 
when we are forbidden to pray in public? 'In every place,' He said, which 
circumstance or even necessity provides. For it is not considered that when the 
Apostles, within the hearing of their guards, prayed in prison and sang to God 
they were acting contrary to the precept any more was Paul when, aboard ship, in 
the sight of all, he gave thanks to God. 
<P>
<P align=center>Chapter 25 
<P>
<P>With regard to the time, the outward observance of certain hours will not be 
without profit. I refer to those hours of community prayer which mark the main 
divisions of the day, namely, Terce, Sext, and None. These, it can be found, are 
mentioned in holy Scripture as being more deserving of note. 
<P>It was at the third hour--Terce--when the disciples were assembled, that the 
Holy Spirit was infused into them for the first time. 
<P>It was at the sixth hour--Sext-- on the day when he had the vision of all 
creatures in the sheet that Peter had climbed to a higher spot in order to pray. 

<P>Similarly, it was at the ninth hour--None--that he went into the Temple with 
John where he restored the paralytic to health. 
<P>Although these incidents simply happen without any precept of observing 
(these hours), it would be good to establish some precedent which would make the 
admonition to pray a binding force to wrest us violently at times, as by a law, 
from our business to such an obligation so that we may offer adoration no less 
than three times a day at least, being debtors to the three divine Persons, 
Father, Son and Holy Spirit. And this, too, we read was observed by Daniel 
according to the rites of Israel. Of course, we are excepting the appropriate 
prayers which are due without any admonition at the approach of dawn and 
evening. 
<P>It is befitting for the faithful not to take food and not to bathe before 
saying a prayer. For the refreshment and food of the spirit are to be put before 
(the needs) of the flesh, because the things of heaven are to be put before 
those of the earth. 
<P>
<P align=center>Chapter 26 
<P>
<P>When a brother has entered your home, do not let him go away without a 
prayer. ('You have seen,' He said, 'a brother; you have seen your Lord'). 
&nbsp;Particularly should this be observed in the case of a stranger, lest he 
should happen to be an angel. 
<P>But, even after one has been welcomed by his brethren, you should not attend 
to earthly refreshment before the heavenly. For immediately will your faith be 
revealed. Or how can you say, according to the precept, 'Peace to this house,' 
unless you exchange the kiss of peace with those who are in the house? 
<P>
<P align=center>Chapter 27 
<P>
<P>Those who are more exact about prayer are in the habit of adding to their 
prayers an 'Alleluia' and psalms of such a character that those who are present 
may respond with the final phrases. Assuredly, the practice is excellent in 
every respect which by its high praise and reverence of God is competent to 
offer Him, as a rich victim, a prayer that has been filled out in every detail. 
<P>
<P align=center>Chapter 28 
<P>
<P>Now, this is the spiritual victim which has set aside the earlier sacrifice. 
'To what purpose do you offer me the multitude of your victims,' saith the Lord? 
'I am full, I desire not holocausts of rams, and fat of fatlings, and blood of 
calves and goats. For who required these things at your hands?' 
<P>The Gospel teaches what God demands. 'The hour is coming,' He says, 'when the 
true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and in truth. &nbsp;For God is 
spirit,' and therefore He requires that His worshipers be of the same nature. 
<P>We are the true worshipers and true priests who, offering our prayer in the 
spirit, offer sacrifice in the spirit--that is, prayer--as a victim that is 
appropriate and acceptable to God; this is what He has demanded and what He has 
foreordained for Himself. 
<P>This prayer, consecrated to Him with our whole heart, nurtured by faith, 
prepared with truth--a prayer that is without blemish because of our innocence, 
clean because of our chastity--a prayer that has received the victor's crown 
because of our love for one another--this prayer we should bring to the altar of 
God with a display of good works amid the singing of psalms and hymns and it 
will obtain for us from God all that we ask. 
<P>
<P align=center>Chapter 29 
<P>
<P>For what will God refuse to the prayer that comes to Him from the spirit and 
in truth, since this is the prayer He has exacted? What proofs of its efficacy 
do we read of an hear of and believe! To be sure, the prayer of old would save 
one from fires and wild beasts and starvation; yet, had not received its form 
from Christ. But how much more wrought by Christian prayer! It does not cause an 
angel (dew to appear in the midst of fire, nor does it stop the mouth of lions 
nor take the breakfast of country folk to the hungry it does not destroy all 
sense of pain by the grace that is conferred; but by patient endurance it 
teaches those who suffer, those who are sensitive, and those who have sorrow; by 
virtue it increases grace that our faith may know what comes from the Lord and 
understand what it suffers for the name of God. 
<P>Then, too, in the past, prayer would impose stripes, set loose the armies of 
the enemy, and prevent the beneficent effects of rain. But now, the prayer of 
justice averts the wrath of God, is on the alert for enemies, and intercedes for 
persecutors. What wonder if it could wrest water from the heavens, when it could 
even ask for fire and obtain it! Prayer alone overcomes God; but Christ has 
willed that it work no evil, upon it He has conferred all power for good. 
Therefore, it has no power except to recall the souls of the dead from the very 
path of death, to make the weak recover, to heal the sick, to exorcise demons, 
to open prison doors, to loosen the chains of the innocent. It likewise remits 
sins, repels temptations, stamps out persecution, consoles the fainthearted, 
delights the courageous, brings travelers safely home, calms the waves, stuns 
robbers, feeds the poor, directs the rich, raises up the fallen, sustains the 
falling, and supports those who are on their feet. 
<P>Prayer is the wall of faith, our shield and weapons against the foe who 
studies us from all sides. Hence, let us never set forth unarmed. Let us be 
mindful of our guard-duty by day and our vigil by night. Beneath the arms of 
prayer let us guard the standard of our general, and let us pray as we await the 
bugle call of the angel. 
<P>All the angels pray, too; every creature prays; the beasts, domestic and 
wild, bend their knees, and as they go forth from their stables and caves they 
look up to heaven with no idle gaze. Even the birds, upon rising in the morning, 
mount into the sky and stretch out their wings as a cross in place of hands and 
say something which might seem to be a prayer. What need, then, is there of 
further discussion of the duty of prayer? Even our Lord Himself prayed, to whom 
be honor and power forever and ever.
