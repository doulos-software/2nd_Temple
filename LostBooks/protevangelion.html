      <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the history of the twelve tribes of 
      Israel we read there was a certain person called Joachim, who being very 
      rich, made double offerings to the Lord God, having made this resolution: 
      "My substance shall be for the benefit of the whole people, and that I may 
      find mercy from the Lord God for the forgiveness of my sins." 
      <SUP>2</SUP>&nbsp;But at a certain great feast of the Lord, when the 
      children of Israel offered their gifts, and Joachim also offered his, 
      Reuben the high priest opposed him, saying, "It is not lawful for you to 
      offer your gifts, seeing you have not begotten any issue in Israel." 
      <SUP>3</SUP>&nbsp;At this Joachim, being concerned very much, went away to 
      consult the registries of the twelve tribes, to see whether he was the 
      only person who had begotten no issue. <SUP>4</SUP>&nbsp;But upon inquiry 
      he found that all the righteous had raised up seed in Israel: 
      <SUP>5</SUP>&nbsp;Then he called to mind the patriarch Abraham, how God in 
      the end of his life had given him his son Isaac; and upon this he was 
      exceedingly distressed, and would not be seen by his wife, 
      <SUP>6</SUP>&nbsp;but retired into the wilderness, and fixed his tent 
      there, and fasted forty days and forty nights, saying to himself, "I will 
      not go down either to eat or drink, till the Lord my God shall look down 
      upon me, but prayer shall be my meat and drink."
      <P>
      <CENTER><B><A name=2>CHAPTER TWO</A></B></CENTER>
      <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the meantime his wife Anna was 
      distressed and perplexed on a double account, and said, "I will mourn both 
      for my widowhood and my barrenness." <SUP>2</SUP>&nbsp;Then drew near a 
      great feast of the Lord, and Judith her maid said, "How long will you thus 
      afflict your soul? The feast of the Lord is now come, when it is unlawful 
      for anyone to mourn. <SUP>3</SUP>&nbsp;Take therefore this hood which was 
      given by one who makes such things, for it is not fit that I, who am a 
      servant, should wear it, but it well suits a person of your greater 
      character." <SUP>4</SUP>&nbsp;But Anna replied, "Depart from me, I am not 
      used to such things; besides, the Lord has greatly humbled me. 
      <SUP>5</SUP>&nbsp;I fear some ill-designing person has given you this, and 
      you have come to pollute me with my sin." <SUP>6</SUP>&nbsp;Then Judith 
      her maid answered, "What evil shall I wish you when you will not hearken 
      to me? <SUP>7</SUP>&nbsp;I cannot wish you a greater curse than you are 
      under, in that God has shut up your womb, that you should not be a mother 
      in Israel." <SUP>8</SUP>&nbsp;At this Anna was exceedingly troubled, and 
      having on her wedding garment, went about the ninth hour to walk in her 
      garden. <SUP>9</SUP>&nbsp;And she saw a laurel tree, and sat under it, and 
      prayed to the Lord, saying, <SUP>10</SUP>&nbsp;"O God of my fathers, bless 
      me and regard my prayer as you did bless the womb of Sarah, and gave her a 
      son, Isaac."
      <P>
      <CENTER><B><A name=3>CHAPTER THREE</A></B></CENTER>
      <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And as she was looking towards heaven she 
      perceived a sparrow's nest in the laurel, <SUP>2</SUP>&nbsp;and mourning 
      within herself, she said, "Woe is me! Who begot me? And what womb did bear 
      me, that I should be thus accursed before the children of Israel, and that 
      they should reproach and deride me in the temple of my God? Woe is me! To 
      what can I be compared? <SUP>3</SUP>I am not comparable to the very beasts 
      of the earth, for even the beasts of the earth are fruitful before You, O 
      Lord! Woe is me! To what can I be compared? <SUP>4</SUP>&nbsp;I am not 
      comparable to the brute animals, for even the brute animals are fruitful 
      before You, O Lord! Woe is me! To what am I comparable<SUP>5</SUP>&nbsp;I 
      cannot be compared to these waters, for even the waters are fruitful 
      before You, O Lord! Woe is me! to what can I be compared? 
      <SUP>6</SUP>&nbsp;I am not comparable to the waves of the sea; for these, 
      whether they are calm or in motion, with the fishes which are in them, 
      praise You, O Lord! Woe is me! To what can I be compared? <SUP>7</SUP>I am 
      not comparable to the very earth, for the earth produces its fruits, and 
      praises You, O Lord!"
      <P>
      <CENTER><B><A name=4>CHAPTER FOUR</A></B></CENTER>
      <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then an angel of the Lord stood by her 
      and said, "Anna, Anna, the Lord has heard your prayer. You shall conceive 
      and bring forth, and your progeny shall be spoken of in all the world." 
      <SUP>2</SUP>&nbsp;And Anna answered, "As the Lord my God lives, whatever I 
      bring forth, whether it is male or female, I will devote it to the Lord my 
      God, and it shall minister to Him in holy things, during its whole life." 
      <SUP>3</SUP>&nbsp;And behold, there appeared two angels, saying to her, 
      "Behold, Joachim you husband is coming with his shepherds. 
      <SUP>4</SUP>&nbsp;For an angel of the Lord has also come down to him, and 
      said, 'The Lord God has heard your prayer; make haste and go from here, 
      for behold, Anna your wife shall conceive.'" <SUP>5</SUP>&nbsp;(And 
      Joachim went down and called his shepherds, saying, "Bring me hither ten 
      she-lambs without spot or blemish, and they shall be for the Lord my God. 
      <SUP>6</SUP>&nbsp;And bring me twelve calves without blemish, and the 
      twelve calves shall be for the priests and the elders. 
      <SUP>7</SUP>&nbsp;Bring me also a hundred goats, and the hundred goats 
      shall be for the whole people.") <SUP>8</SUP>&nbsp;And Joachim went down 
      with the shepherds, and Anna stood by the gate and saw Joachim coming with 
      the shepherds. <SUP>9</SUP>&nbsp;And she ran and, hanging about his neck, 
      said, "Now I know that the Lord has greatly blessed me; 
      <SUP>10</SUP>&nbsp;for behold, I who was a widow am no longer a widow, and 
      I who was barren shall conceive."
      <P><FONT color=#000000>
      <CENTER><B><A name=5>CHAPTER FIVE</A></B></CENTER>
      <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Joachim abode the first day in his 
      house, but on the morrow he brought his offerings and said, 
      <SUP>2</SUP>&nbsp;"If the Lord is propitious to me, let the plate which is 
      on the priest's forehead make it manifest." <SUP>3</SUP>&nbsp;And he 
      consulted the plate which the priest wore, and saw it, and behold, sin was 
      not found in him. <SUP>4</SUP>&nbsp;And Joachim said, "Now I know that the 
      Lord is propitious to me, and has taken away all my sins." 
      <SUP>5</SUP>&nbsp;And he went down from the temple of the Lord justified, 
      and he went to his own house. <SUP>6</SUP>&nbsp;And when nine months were 
      fulfilled to Anna, she brought forth, and said to the midwife, "What have 
      I brought forth?" <SUP>7</SUP>&nbsp;And she told her, "A girl." 
      <SUP>8</SUP>&nbsp;Then Anna said, "The Lord has this day magnified my 
      soul." And she lay in her bed. <SUP>9</SUP>&nbsp;And when the days of her 
      purification were accomplished, she gave suck to the child, and called her 
      name Mary.
      <P>
      <CENTER><B><A name=6>CHAPTER SIX</A></B></CENTER>
      <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the child increased in strength every 
      day, so that when she was nine months old, her mother put her upon the 
      ground to try if she could stand, and when she had walked nine steps, she 
      came again to her mother's lap. <SUP>2</SUP>&nbsp;then her mother caught 
      her up, and said, "As the Lord my God lives, you shall not walk again on 
      the earth till I bring you into the temple of the Lord." 
      <SUP>3</SUP>&nbsp;Accordingly she made her chamber a holy place, and 
      allowed nothing uncommon or unclean to come near her, but invited certain 
      undefiled daughters of Israel, and they drew her aside. 
      <SUP>4</SUP>&nbsp;But when the child was a year old, Joachim made a great 
      feast, and invited the priests, scribes, elders, and all the people of 
      Israel. <SUP>5</SUP>&nbsp;And Joachim then made an offering of the girl to 
      the chief priests, and they blessed her, saying, "The God of our fathers 
      bless this girl, and give her a name famous and lasting through all 
      generations." And all the people replied, "So be it. Amen." 
      <SUP>6</SUP>&nbsp;Then Joachim a second time offered her to the priests, 
      and they blessed her, saying, "O Most HighGod, regard this girl and bless 
      her with an everlasting blessing." <SUP>7</SUP>&nbsp;Upon this, her mother 
      took her up and gave her the breast and sung the following song to the 
      Lord: <SUP>8</SUP>&nbsp;I will sing a new song to the Lord, my God, for He 
      has visited me, and taken away from me the reproach of my enemies, and has 
      given me the fruit of His righteousness, that it may now be told the sons 
      of Reuben, that Anna gives suck." <SUP>9</SUP>&nbsp;Then she put the child 
      to rest in the room which she had consecrated, and she went out and served 
      them. <SUP>10</SUP>&nbsp;And when the feast was ended, they went away 
      rejoicing and praising the God of Israel.
      <P>
      <CENTER><B><A name=7>CHAPTER SEVEN</A></B></CENTER>
      <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the child grew, and when she was two 
      years old, Joachim said to Anna, "Let us lead her to the temple of the 
      Lord, that we may perform our vow, which we have vowed to the Lord God, 
      lest He should be angry with us, and our offering be unacceptable." 
      <SUP>2</SUP>&nbsp;But Anna said, "Let us wait the third year, lest she 
      should be at a loss to know her father." And Joachim said, "Let us then 
      wait." <SUP>3</SUP>&nbsp;And when the child was three years old, Joachim 
      said, "Let us invite the daughters of the Hebrews, who are undefiled, and 
      let them take each a lamp, and let them be lighted, that the child may not 
      turn back again, and her mind be set against the temple of the Lord." 
      <SUP>4</SUP>&nbsp;And they did thus till they ascended into the temple of 
      the Lord. And the high priest received her, and blessed her, and said, 
      "Mary, the Lord God has magnified your name to all generations. And to the 
      very end of time, the Lord by you will show his redemption to the children 
      of Israel." <SUP>5</SUP>&nbsp;And he placed her on the third step of the 
      altar, and the Lord gave to her grace, and she danced with her feet, and 
      all the house of Israel loved her.
      <P>
      <CENTER><B><A name=8>CHAPTER EIGHT</A></B></CENTER>
      <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And her parents went away filled with 
      wonder, and praising God, because the girl did not return back to them. 
      <SUP>2</SUP>&nbsp;But Mary continued in the temple as a dove educated 
      there, and received her food from the hand of an angel. 
      <SUP>3</SUP>&nbsp;And when she was twelve years of age, the priests met in 
      a council, and said, "Behold, Mary is twelve years of age. What shall we 
      do with her, for fear lest the holy place of the Lord our God should be 
      defiled?" <SUP>4</SUP>&nbsp;Then the priests replied to Zachary the high 
      priest, "Stand at the altar of the Lord, and enter into the holy place, 
      and make petitions concerning her, and whatever the Lord shall manifest to 
      you, do that." <SUP>5</SUP>&nbsp;Then the high priest entered into the 
      Holy of Holies and, taking away with him the breastplate of judgment, made 
      prayers concerning her. <SUP>6</SUP>&nbsp;And behold, an angel of the Lord 
      came to him and said, "Zachary, Zachary, go forth and call together all 
      the widowers among the people, and let every one of them bring his rod, 
      and he by whom the Lord shall show a sign shall be the husband of Mary." 
      <SUP>7</SUP>&nbsp;And the criers went out throughout all Judaea, and the 
      trumpet of the Lord sounded, and all the people ran and met together.
      <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<SUP>8</SUP>&nbsp;Joseph also, throwing 
      away the hatchet, went out to meet them, and when they were met, they went 
      to the high priest, taking every man his rod. <SUP>9</SUP>&nbsp;After the 
      high priest had received their rods, he went into the temple to pray. 
      <SUP>10</SUP>&nbsp;And when he had finished his prayer, he took the rods, 
      and went forth and distributed them, and there was no miracle attending 
      them. <SUP>11</SUP>&nbsp;The last rod was taken by Joseph, and behold, a 
      dove proceeded out of the rod, and flew upon the head of Joseph. 
      <SUP>12</SUP>&nbsp;And the high priest said, "Joseph, you are the person 
      chosen to take the Virgin of the Lord, to keep her for him." 
      <SUP>13</SUP>&nbsp;But Joseph refused, saying, "I am an old man, and have 
      children, but she is young, and I fear lest I should appear ridiculous in 
      Israel." <SUP>14</SUP>&nbsp;then the high priest replied, "Joseph, fear 
      the Lord your God, and remember how God dealt with Dathan, Korah, and 
      Abiram, how the earth opened and swallowed them up, because of their 
      contradiction. <SUP>15</SUP>Now therefore, Joseph, fear God, lest the like 
      things should happen in your family." <SUP>16</SUP>&nbsp;Joseph then, 
      being afraid, took her to his house, and Joseph said to Mary, "Behold, I 
      have taken you from the temple of the Lord, and now I will leave you in my 
      house. I must go to mind my trade of building. The Lord be with you."
      <P><FONT color=#000000>
      <CENTER><B><A name=9>CHAPTER NINE</A></B></CENTER>
      <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And it came to pass, in a council of 
      priests, that it was said, "Let us make a new veil for the temple." 
      <SUP>2</SUP>&nbsp;And the high priest said, "Call together to me seven 
      undefiled virgins of the tribe of David." <SUP>3</SUP>&nbsp;And the 
      servants went and brought them into the temple of the Lord, and the high 
      priest said to them, "Cast lots before me now, who of you shall spin the 
      gold thread, who the blue, who the scarlet,, who the fine linen, and who 
      the true purple." <SUP>4</SUP>&nbsp;then the high priest knew Mary, that 
      she was of the tribe of David, and he called her, and the true purple fell 
      to her lot to spin, and she went away to her own home. 
      <SUP>5</SUP>&nbsp;But from that time Zachary the high priest became dumb, 
      and Samuel was placed in his stead till Zachary spoke again. 
      <SUP>6</SUP>&nbsp;But Mary took the true purple, and spun it.
      <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<SUP>7</SUP>&nbsp;And she took a pot, and 
      went out to draw water, and heard a voice saying to her, "Hail, you who 
      are full of grace, the Lord is with you. You are blessed among women." 
      <SUP>8</SUP>&nbsp;And she looked around to the right and to the left to 
      see from where the voice came, and then, trembling, went into her house, 
      and laying down the water-pot she took the purple, and sat down in her 
      seat to work it. <SUP>9</SUP>&nbsp;And behold, the angel of the Lord stood 
      by her, and said, "Fear not, Mary, for you have found favor in the sight 
      of God." <SUP>10</SUP>&nbsp;When she heard it, she reasoned within herself 
      what that sort of greeting meant. <SUP>11</SUP>&nbsp;And the angel said to 
      her, "The Lord is with you, and you shall conceive," <SUP>12</SUP>&nbsp;to 
      which she replied, "What! Shall I conceive by the living God, and bring 
      forth as all other women do?" <SUP>13</SUP>&nbsp;But the angel replied, 
      "Not so, Mary, but the Holy Spirit shall come upon you, and the power of 
      the Most High shall overshadow you; <SUP>14</SUP>&nbsp;therefore, that 
      which shall be born of you shall be holy, and shall be called the Son of 
      the Living God, and you shall call his name Jesus, for He shall save His 
      people from their sins. <SUP>15</SUP>&nbsp;And behold, your cousin 
      Elizabeth, she also has conceived a son in her old age, 
      <SUP>16</SUP>&nbsp;and this is now the sixth month with her, who was 
      called barren, for nothing is impossible with God." <SUP>17</SUP>&nbsp;And 
      Mary said, "Behold the handmaid of the Lord; let it be to me according to 
      your word."
      <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<SUP>18</SUP>&nbsp;And when she had 
      wrought her purple, she carried it to the high priest, and the high priest 
      blessed her, saying, "Mary, the Lord God has magnified your name, and you 
      shall be blessed in all the ages of the world." <SUP>19</SUP>&nbsp;Then 
      Mary, filled with joy, went away to her cousin Elizabeth, and knocked at 
      the door. <SUP>20</SUP>&nbsp;When Elizabeth heard it, she ran and opened 
      to her, and blessed her, and said, "How is this come to me, that the 
      mother of my Lord should come to me? <SUP>21</SUP>&nbsp;For lo! as soon as 
      the voice of your greeting reached my ears, that which is in me leaped, 
      and blessed you." <SUP>22</SUP>&nbsp;But Mary, being ignorant of all those 
      mysterious things which the archangel Gabriel had spoken to her, lifted up 
      her eyes to heaven, and said, "Lord! What am I, that all the generations 
      of the earth should call me blessed?" <SUP>23</SUP>&nbsp;But perceiving 
      herself daily to grow big, and being afraid, she went home, and hid 
      herself from the children of Israel. And she <A name=age>was</A> 
      sixteen years old when all these things happened.
      <P>
      <CENTER><B><A name=10>CHAPTER TEN</A></B></CENTER>
      <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when her sixth month was come, Joseph 
      returned from his building houses abroad, which was his trade, and 
      entering into the house, found the Virgin grown big. 
      <SUP>2</SUP>&nbsp;Then, smiting upon his face, he said, "With what face 
      can I look up to the Lord my God? Or what shall I say concerning this 
      young woman? <SUP>3</SUP>&nbsp;For I received her a Virgin from the temple 
      of the Lord my God, and have not preserved her such! Who has thus deceived 
      me? <SUP>4 </SUP>Who has committed this evil in my house and, seducing the 
      Virgin from me, has defiled her? <SUP>5</SUP>&nbsp;Is not the history of 
      Adam exactly accomplished in me? <SUP>6</SUP>&nbsp;For in the very instant 
      of his glory, the serpent came and found Eve alone, and seduced her. 
      <SUP>7</SUP>&nbsp;Just after the same manner it has happened to me." 
      <SUP>8</SUP>&nbsp;Then Joseph, arising from the ground, called her and 
      said, "O you who have been so much favored by God, why have you done this? 
      <SUP>9</SUP>&nbsp;Why have you thus debased your soul, who were educated 
      in the Holy of Holies, and received your food from the hand of angels?" 
      <SUP>10</SUP>&nbsp;But she, with a flood of tears, replied, "I am 
      innocent, and have known no man." <SUP>11</SUP>&nbsp;Then said Joseph, 
      "How does it come to pass that you are with child?" 
      <SUP>12</SUP>&nbsp;Mary answered, "As the Lord my God lives, I do not know 
      by what means."
      <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<SUP>13</SUP>Then Joseph was exceedingly 
      afraid, and went away from her, considering what he should do with her. 
      And thus he reasoned with himself: <SUP>14</SUP>&nbsp;"If I conceal her 
      crime, I shall be found guilty by the law of the Lord; 
      <SUP>15</SUP>&nbsp;and if I reveal her to the children of Israel, I fear 
      lest -- she being with child by an angel -- I shall be found to betray the 
      life of an innocent person. <SUP>16</SUP>&nbsp;What, therefore, shall I 
      do? I will privately dismiss her." <SUP>17</SUP>&nbsp;Then the night was 
      come upon him, when behold an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a 
      dream, and said, <SUP>18</SUP>&nbsp;"Do not be afraid to take that young 
      woman, for That which is within her is of the Holy Spirit, 
      <SUP>19</SUP>&nbsp;and she shall bring forth a Son, and you shall call His 
      name Jesus, for He shall save His people from their sins. 
      <SUP>20</SUP>&nbsp;Then Joseph arose from his sleep, and glorified the God 
      of Israel, who had shown him such favor, and preserved the Virgin.

      <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then came Annas the scribe, and said to 
      Joseph, "Why have we not seen you since your return?" 
      <SUP>2</SUP>&nbsp;And Joseph replied, "Because I was weary after my 
      journey, and rested the first day." <SUP>3</SUP>&nbsp;But Annas, turning 
      about, perceived the Virgin big with child. <SUP>4</SUP>&nbsp;And he went 
      away to the priest and told him, "Joseph in whom you placed so much 
      confidence is guilty of a notorious crime, in that he has defiled the 
      Birgin whom he received out of the temple of the Lord, and has privately 
      married her, not revealing it to the children of Israel." 
      <SUP>5</SUP>&nbsp;Then said the priest, "Has Joseph done this?" 
      <SUP>6</SUP>&nbsp;Annas replied, "If you send any of your servants, you 
      will find that she is with child." <SUP>7</SUP>&nbsp;And the servants 
      went, and found it as he said. <SUP>8</SUP>&nbsp;Upon this, both she and 
      Joseph were brought to their trial, and the priest said to her, "Mary, 
      what have you done? <SUP>9</SUP>&nbsp;Why have you debased your soul, and 
      forgotten your God, seeing you were brought up in the Holy of Holies, and 
      received your food from the hands of angels, and heard their songs? 
      <SUP>10</SUP>&nbsp;Why have you done this?" <SUP>11</SUP>&nbsp;To which, 
      with a flood of tears, she answered, "As the Lord my God lives, I am 
      innocent in His sight, seeing I know no man." <SUP>12</SUP>&nbsp;Then the 
      priest said to Joseph, "Why have you done this?" <SUP>13</SUP>&nbsp;And 
      Joseph answered, "As the Lord my God lives, I have not been concerned with 
      her." <SUP>14</SUP>&nbsp;But the priest said, "Do not lie, but declare the 
      truth. You have privately married her, and not revealed it to the children 
      of Israel, and humbled yourself under the Mighty Hand, that your seed 
      might be blessed." <SUP>15</SUP>&nbsp;And Joseph was silent. 
      <SUP>16</SUP>&nbsp;Then said the priest, "You must restore to the temple 
      of the Lord the Virgin whom you took from there." <SUP>17</SUP>&nbsp;But 
      he wept bitterly. And the priest added, "I will cause you both <A 
      name=both>to</A> drink the 
      water of the Lord, which is for trial, and so your iniquity shall be laid open 
      before you." <SUP>18</SUP>&nbsp;Then the priest took the water, and made 
      Joseph drink, and sent him to a mountainous place. <SUP>19</SUP>&nbsp;And 
      he returned perfectly well, and all the people marveled that his guilt was 
      not revealed. <SUP>20</SUP>&nbsp;So the priest said, "Since the Lord has 
      not made your sins evident, neither do I condemn you." 
      <SUP>21</SUP>&nbsp;So he sent them away. <SUP>22</SUP>&nbsp;Then Joseph 
      took Mary, and went to his house, rejoicing and praising the God of 
Israel.

      <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And it came to pass that there went forth 
      a decree from the Emperor Augustus, that all the Jews should be taxed, who 
      were of Bethlehem in Judaea. <SUP>2</SUP>&nbsp;And Joseph said, "I will 
      take care that my children are taxed, but what shall I do with this young 
      woman? <SUP>3</SUP>&nbsp;To have her taxed as my wife I am ashamed, and if 
      I tax her as my daughter, all Israel knows she is not my daughter. 
      <SUP>4</SUP>&nbsp;When the time of the Lord's appointment shall come, let 
      Him do as seems good to Him." <SUP>5</SUP>&nbsp;And he saddled the ass, 
      and put her upon it, and Joseph and Simon followed after her, and came 
      near Bethlehem, within three miles. <SUP>6</SUP>&nbsp;Then Joseph, turning 
      about, saw Mary sorrowful, and said within himself, "Perhaps she is in 
      pain through That which is within her." <SUP>7</SUP>&nbsp;But when he 
      turned about again, he saw her laughing, and said to her, 
      <SUP>8</SUP>&nbsp;"Mary, how does it happen that I sometimes see sorrow 
      and sometimes laughter and joy in your face?" <SUP>9</SUP>&nbsp;And Mary 
      replied to him, "I see two people with my eyes, the one weeping and 
      mourning, the other laughing and rejoicing." <SUP>10</SUP>&nbsp;And he 
      went again across the way, and Mary said to Joseph, "Take me down from the 
      ass, for That which is in me presses to come forth." 
      <SUP>11</SUP>&nbsp;But Joseph replied, "Where shall I take you? For the 
      place is desolate." <SUP>12</SUP>&nbsp;Then Mary said again to Joseph, 
      "Take me down, for That which is within me mightily presses me." 
      <SUP>13</SUP>&nbsp;And Joseph took her down. <SUP>14</SUP>&nbsp;And he 
      found a cave there, and led her into it.

      <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And leaving her and his sons in the cave, 
      Joseph went forth to seek a Hebrew midwife in the village of Bethlehem. 
      <SUP>2</SUP>&nbsp;"But as I was going," said Joseph, I looked up into the 
      air, and I saw the clouds astonished, and the fowls of the air stopping in 
      the midst of their flight. <SUP>3</SUP>&nbsp;And I looked down towards the 
      earth, and saw a table spread, and working people sitting around it, but 
      their hands were upon the table, and they did not move to eat. 
      <SUP>4</SUP>&nbsp;They who had meat in their mouths did not eat. 
      <SUP>5</SUP>&nbsp;They who lifted their hands up to their heads did not 
      draw them back, <SUP>6</SUP>&nbsp;and they who lifted them up to their 
      mouths did not put anything in, <SUP>7</SUP>&nbsp;but all their faces were 
      fixed upwards. <SUP>8</SUP>&nbsp;And I beheld the sheep dispersed, and yet 
      the sheep stood still. <SUP>9</SUP>&nbsp;And the shepherd lifted up his 
      hand to smite them, and his hand continued up. <SUP>10</SUP>&nbsp;And I 
      looked to a river, and saw the kids with their mouths close to the water, 
      and touching it, but they did not drink."
      <P>
      <CENTER><B><A name=14>CHAPTER FOURTEEN</A></B></CENTER>
      <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Then I beheld a woman coming down from 
      the mountains, and she said, 'Where are you going, O man?' 
      <SUP>2</SUP>&nbsp;And I said to her, 'I go to inquire for a Hebrew 
      midwife.' <SUP>3</SUP>&nbsp;She replied to me, 'Where is the woman who is 
      to be delivered?' <SUP>4</SUP>&nbsp;And I answered, 'In the cave, and she 
      is betrothed to me.'" <SUP>5</SUP>&nbsp;Then said the midwife, "Is she not 
      your wife?" <SUP>6</SUP>&nbsp;Joseph answered, "It is Mary, who was 
      educated in the Holy of Holies, in the house of the Lord, and she fell to 
      my lot, and is not my wife, but has conceived by the Holy Spirit." 
      <SUP>7</SUP>&nbsp;The midwife said, "Is this true?" <SUP>8</SUP>&nbsp;He 
      answered, "Come and see." <SUP>9</SUP>&nbsp;And the midwife went along 
      with him, and stood in the cave. <SUP>10</SUP>&nbsp;Then a bright cloud 
      overshadowed the cave, and the midwife said, "This day my soul is 
      magnified, for my eyes have seen surprising things, and salvation is 
      brought forth to Israel." <SUP>11</SUP>&nbsp;But of a sudden the cloud 
      became a great light in the cave, so that their eyes could not bear it. 
      <SUP>12</SUP>&nbsp;But the light gradually decreased, until the infant 
      appeared, and sucked the breast of his mother Mary. 
      <SUP>13</SUP>&nbsp;Then the midwife cried out, and said, "How glorious a 
      day is this, wherein my eyes have seen this extraordinary sight! 
      <SUP>14</SUP>&nbsp;And the midwife went out from the cave, and Salome met 
      her. <SUP>15</SUP>&nbsp;And the midwife said to her, "Salome, Salome, I 
      will tell you a most surprising thing, which I saw. <SUP>16</SUP>&nbsp;A 
      virgin has brought forth, which is a thing contrary to nature." 
      <SUP>17</SUP>&nbsp;To which Salome replied, "As the Lord my God lives, 
      unless I receive particular proof of this matter, I will not believe that 
      a virgin has brought forth."
      <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<SUP>18</SUP>&nbsp;Then Salome went in, 
      and the midwife said, "Mary, show yourself, for a great controversy has 
      arisen about you." <SUP>19</SUP>&nbsp;And Salome tested her with her 
      finger. <SUP>20</SUP>&nbsp;But her hand was withered, and she groaned 
      bitterly, <SUP>21</SUP>&nbsp;and said, "Woe to me, because of my iniquity! 
      For I have tempted the living God, and my hand is ready to drop off." 
      <SUP>22</SUP>&nbsp;Then Salome made her supplication to the Lord, and 
      said, "O God of my fathers, remember me, for I am of the seed of Abraham, 
      and Isaac, and Jacob. <SUP>23</SUP>&nbsp;Make me not a reproach among the 
      children of Israel, but restore me sound to my parents. 
      <SUP>24</SUP>&nbsp;For You well know, O Lord, that I have performed many 
      works of charity in Your name, and have received my reward from You." 
      <SUP>25</SUP>&nbsp;Upon this an angel of the Lord stood by Salome and 
      said, "The Lord God has heard your prayer; reach forth your hand to the 
      Child, and carry Him, and by that means you shall be restored." 
      <SUP>26</SUP>&nbsp;Salome, filled with exceeding joy, went to the child, 
      and said, "I will touch Him." <SUP>27</SUP>&nbsp;And she purposed to 
      worship Him, for she said, "This is a great King who is born in Israel." 
      <SUP>28</SUP>&nbsp;And straightway Salome was cured. 
      <SUP>29</SUP>&nbsp;Then the midwife went out of the cave, being approved 
      by God. <SUP>30</SUP>&nbsp;And lo! a voice came to Salome, "Declare not 
      the strange things which you have seen, till the Child shall come to 
      Jerusalem." <SUP>So Salome also departed, approved by God.</SUP>

      <CENTER><B><A name=15>CHAPTER FIFTEEN</A></B></CENTER>
      <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Joseph was preparing to go away, 
      because there arose a great disorder in Bethlehem by the coming of some 
      wise men from the east, <SUP>2</SUP>&nbsp;who said, "Where is the king of 
      the Jews born? For we have seen his star in the east, and have come to 
      worship him." <SUP>3</SUP>&nbsp;When Herod heard this, he was exceedingly 
      troubled, and sent messengers to the wise men, and to the priests, and 
      inquired of his officials, <SUP>4</SUP>&nbsp;and said to them, "Where do 
      you have it written concerning Christ the King, or where should He be 
      born?" <SUP>5</SUP>&nbsp;Then they say to him, "In Bethlehem of Judaea, 
      for so it is written: 'And you, Bethlehem in the land of Judah, are not 
      the least among the princes of Judah, for out of you shall come a Ruler 
      who shall rule my people Israel.'" <SUP>6</SUP>&nbsp;And having sent away 
      the chief priests, he inquired of the wise men, and said to them, "What 
      sign was it you saw, concerning the King who is born?" 
      <SUP>7</SUP>&nbsp;They answered him, "We saw an extraordinarily large star 
      shining among the stars of heaven, and so outshining all the other stars 
      that they became invisible, and we knew thereby that a great King was born 
      in Israel, and therefore we have come to worship him." 
      <SUP>8</SUP>&nbsp;Then Herod said to them, "Go and make diligent inquiry, 
      and if you find the Child, bring me word again, that I may come and 
      worship Him also." <SUP>9</SUP>&nbsp;So the wise men went forth, and 
      behold, the star which they saw in the east went before them, till it came 
      and stood over the cave where the young Child was with Mary His mother. 
      <SUP>10</SUP>&nbsp;Then they brought forth out of their treasures, and 
      offered to Him gold and frankincense, and myrrh. <SUP>11</SUP>&nbsp;And 
      being warned in a dream by an angel that they should not return to Herod 
      through Judaea, they departed into their own country by another way.
      <P>
      <CENTER><B><A name=16>CHAPTER SIXTEEN</A></B></CENTER>
      <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Herod, perceiving that he was being 
      mocked by the wise men, and being very angry, commanded certain men to go 
      and to kill all the children who were in Bethlehem, from two years old and 
      under. <SUP>2</SUP>&nbsp;But Mary, hearing that the children were to be 
      killed, being under much fear, took the Child, and wrapped Him up in 
      swaddling clothes, and laid Him in an ox-manger, because there was no 
      roiom for them in the inn. <SUP>3</SUP>&nbsp;Elizabeth also, hearing that 
      her son John was about to be searched for, took him and went up into the 
      mountains, and looked around for a place to hide him; 
      <SUP>4</SUP>&nbsp;and there was no place to be found. 
      <SUP>5</SUP>&nbsp;Then she groaned within herself, and said, "O mountain 
      of the Lord, receive the mother with the child." <SUP>6</SUP>&nbsp;For 
      Elizabeth could not climb up. <SUP>7</SUP>&nbsp;And instantly the mountain 
      was divided and received them. <SUP>8</SUP>&nbsp;And there appeared to 
      them an angel of the Lord, to preserve them.
      <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<SUP>9</SUP>&nbsp;But Herod made search 
      after John, and sent servants to Zachary, when he was at the altar, and 
      said to him, "Where have you hidden your son?" <SUP>10</SUP>&nbsp;He 
      replied to them, "I am a servant of God, and a servant at the altar; how 
      should I know where my son is?" <SUP>11</SUP>&nbsp;So the servants went 
      back, and told Herod everything, at which he was incensed, and said, "Is 
      ot this son of his likely to be king in Israel?" 
      <SUP>12</SUP>&nbsp;Therefore he sent his servants again to Zachary, 
      saying, "Tell us the truth, where is your son? For you know that your life 
      is in my hand." <SUP>13</SUP>&nbsp;So the servants went and told him all 
      this. <SUP>14</SUP>&nbsp;But Zachary replied to them, "I am a martyr for 
      God, and if he shed my blood, the Lord will receive my soul. 
      <SUP>15</SUP>&nbsp;Besides, know that you shed innocent blood." 
      <SUP>16</SUP>&nbsp;However, Zachary was murdered at the entrance of the 
      temple and altar, and about the partition. <SUP>17</SUP>&nbsp;But the 
      children of Israel knew not when he was killed.
      <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<SUP>18</SUP>&nbsp;Then at the hour of 
      salutation the priests went into the temple, but Zachary did not, 
      according to custom, meet them and bless them, <SUP>19</SUP>&nbsp;But 
      still they continued waiting for him to salute them. 
      <SUP>20</SUP>&nbsp;And when they found he did not come in a long time, one 
      of them ventured into the holy place where the altar was, and he saw blood 
      lying upon the ground, congealed. <SUP>21</SUP>&nbsp;Then, behold, a voice 
      from heaven said, "Zachary is murdered, and his blood shall not be wiped 
      away, until the avenger of his blood comes." <SUP>22</SUP>&nbsp;And when 
      he heard this, he was afraid, and went forth and told the priests what he 
      had seen and heard. And they all went in, and saw the fact. 
      <SUP>23</SUP>&nbsp;Then the roofs of the temple howled, and were rent from 
      the top to the bottom, <SUP>24</SUP>&nbsp;and they could not find the 
      body, but only blood made hard like stone. <SUP>25</SUP>&nbsp;And they 
      went away, and told the people that Zachary was murdered, and all the 
      tribes of Israel heard of it, and mourned for him, and lamented three 
      days. <SUP>26</SUP>&nbsp;Then the priests took counsel together concerning 
      a person to succeed him. <SUP>27</SUP>&nbsp;And Simeon and the other 
      priests cast lots, and the lot fell upon Simeon. <SUP>28</SUP>&nbsp;For he 
      had been assured by the Holy Spirit, that he should not die, till he had 
      seen Christ come in the flesh.
      <P>
