<P align=left>Ignatius, who is also called Theophorus, to the Church of God 
which is at Philippi, which has obtained mercy in faith, and patience, and love 
unfeigned: Mercy and peace from God the Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ, "who 
is the Saviour of all men, specially of them that believe." 
<H2 align=center>Chapter 1 </H2>
<H3 align=center>Reason For Writing The Epistle </H3>
<P align=left>Being mindful of your love and of your zeal in Christ, which ye 
have manifested towards us we thought it fitting to write to you, who display 
such a godly and spiritual love to the brethren, to put you in remembrance of 
your Christian course, "that ye all speak the same thing, being of one mind, 
thinking the same thing, and walking by the same rule of faith," as Paul 
admonished you. For if there is one God of the universe, the Father of Christ, 
"of whom are all things;" and one Lord Jesus Christ, our [Lord], "by whom are 
all things;" and also one Holy Spirit, who wrought in Moses, and in the prophets 
and apostles; and also one baptism, which is administered that we should have 
fellowship with the death of the Lord; and also one elect Church; there ought 
likewise to be but one faith in respect to Christ. For "there is one Lord, one 
faith, one baptism; one God and Father of all, who is through all, and in all." 
<H2 align=center>Chapter 2 </H2>
<H3 align=center>Unity Of The Three Divine Persons </H3>
<P align=left>There is then one God and Father, and not two or three; One who 
is; and there is no other besides Him, the only true [God]. For "the Lord thy 
God," saith [the Scripture], "is one Lord." And again, "Hath not one God created 
us? Have we not all one Father? And there is also one Son, God the Word. For 
"the only-begotten Son," saith [the Scripture], "who is in the bosom of the 
Father." And again, "One Lord Jesus Christ." And in another place, "What is His 
name, or what His Son's name, that we may know?" And there is also one 
Paraclete. For "there is also," saith [the Scripture], "one Spirit," since "we 
have been called in one hope of our calling." And again, "We have drunk of one 
Spirit," with what follows. And it is manifest that all these gifts [possessed 
by believers] "worketh one and the self-same Spirit." There are not then either 
three Fathers, or three Sons, or three Paracletes, but one Father, and one Son, 
and one Paraclete. Wherefore also the Lord, when He sent forth the apostles to 
make disciples of all nations, commanded them to "baptize in the name of the 
Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost," not unto one [person] having 
three names, nor into three [persons] who became incarnate, but into three 
possessed of equal honour. 
<H2 align=center>Chapter 3 </H2>
<H3 align=center>Christ Was Truly Born, And Died </H3>
<P align=left>For there is but One that became incarnate, and that neither the 
Father nor the Paraclete, but the Son only, [who became so] not in appearance or 
imagination, but in reality. For "the Word became flesh." For "Wisdom builded 
for herself a house." And God the Word was born as man, with a body, of the 
Virgin, without any intercourse of man. For [it is written], "A virgin shall 
conceive in her womb, and bring forth a son." He was then truly born, truly grew 
up, truly ate and drank, was truly crucified, and died, and rose again. He who 
believes these things, as they really were, and as they really took place, is 
blessed. He who believeth them not is no less accursed than those who crucified 
the Lord. For the prince of this world rejoiceth when any one denies the cross, 
since he knows that the confession of the cross is his own destruction. For that 
is the trophy which has been raised up against his power, which when he sees, he 
shudders, and when he hears of, is afraid. 
<H2 align=center>Chapter 4 </H2>
<H3 align=center>The Malignity And Folly Of Satan </H3>
<P align=left>And indeed, before the cross was erected, he (Satan) was eager 
that it should be so; and he "wrought" [for this end] "in the children of 
disobedience." He wrought in Judas, in the Pharisees, in the Sadducees, in the 
old, in the young, and in the priests. But when it was just about to be erected, 
he was troubled, and infused repentance into the traitor, and pointed him to a 
rope to hang himself with, and taught him [to die by] strangulation. He 
terrified also the silly woman, disturbing her by dreams; and he, who had tried 
every means to have the cross prepared, now endeavoured to put a stop to its 
erection; not that he was influenced by repentance on account of the greatness 
of his crime (for in that case he would not be utterly depraved), but because he 
perceived his own destruction [to be at hand]. For the cross of Christ was the 
beginning of his condemnation the beginning of his death, the beginning of his 
destruction. Wherefore, also, he works in some that they should deny the cross, 
be ashamed of the passion, call the death an appearance, mutilate and explain 
away the birth of the Virgin, and calumniate the [human] nature s itself as 
being abominable. He fights along with the Jews to a denial of the cross, and 
with the Gentiles to the calumniating of Mary, who are heretical in holding that 
Christ possessed a mere phantasmal body. For the leader of all wickedness 
assumes manifold forms, beguiler of men as he is, inconsistent, and even 
contradicting himself, projecting one course and then following another. For he 
is wise to do evil, but as to what good may be he is totally ignorant. And 
indeed he is full of ignorance, on account of his voluntary want of reason: for 
how can he be deemed anything else who does not perceive reason when it lies at 
his very feet? 
<H2 align=center>Chapter 5 </H2>
<H3 align=center>Apostrophe To Satan </H3>
<P align=left>For if the Lord were a mere man, possessed of a soul and body 
only, why dost thou mutilate and explain away His being born with the common 
nature of humanity? Why dost thou call the passion a mere appearance, as if it 
were any strange thing happening to a [mere] man? And why dost thou reckon the 
death of a mortal to be simply an imaginary death? But if, [on the other hand,] 
He is both God and man, then why dost thou call it unlawful to style Him "the 
Lord of glory," who is by nature unchangeable? Why dost thou say that it is 
unlawful to declare of the Lawgiver who possesses a human soul, "The Word was 
made flesh," and was a perfect man, and not merely one dwelling in a man? But 
how came this magician into existence, who of old formed all nature that can be 
apprehended either by the senses or intellect, according to the will of the 
Father; and, when He became incarnate, healed every kind of disease and 
infirmity? 
<H2 align=center>Chapter 6 </H2>
<H3 align=center>Continuation </H3>
<P align=left>And how can He be but God, who raises up the dead, sends away the 
lame sound of limb, cleanses the lepers, restores sight to the blind, and either 
increases or transmutes existing substances, as the five loaves and the two 
fishes, and the water which became wine, and who puts to flight thy whole host 
by a mere word? And why dost thou abuse the nature of the Virgin, and style her 
members disgraceful, since thou didst of old display such in public processions, 
and didst order them to be exhibited naked, males in the sight of females, and 
females to stir up the unbridled lust of males? But now these are reckoned by 
thee disgraceful, and thou pretendest to be full of modesty, thou spirit of 
fornication, not knowing that then only anything becomes disgraceful when it is 
polluted by wickedness. But when sin is not present, none of the things that 
have been created are shameful, none of them evil, but all very good. But 
inasmuch as thou art blind, thou revilest these things. 
<H2 align=center>Chapter 7 </H2>
<H3 align=center>Continuation: Inconsistency Of Satan </H3>
<P align=left>And how, again, does Christ not at all appear to thee to be of the 
Virgin, but to be God over all, and the Almighty? Say, then, who sent Him? Who 
was Lord over Him ? And whose will did He obey? And what laws did He fulfil, 
since He was subject neither to the will nor power of any one? And while you 
deny that Christ was born, you affirm that the unbegotten was begotten, and that 
He who had no beginning was nailed to the cross, by whose permission I am unable 
to say. But thy changeable tactics do not escape me, nor am I ignorant that thou 
art wont to walk with slanting and uncertain steps. And thou art ignorant who 
really was born, thou who pretendest to know everything. 
<H2 align=center>Chapter 8 </H2>
<H3 align=center>Continuation: Ignorance Of Satan </H3>
<P align=left>For many things are unknown to thee; [such as the following]: the 
virginity of Mary; the wonderful birth; Who it was that became incarnate; the 
star which guided those who were in the east; the Magi who presented gifts; the 
salutation of the archangel to the Virgin; the marvellous conception of her that 
was betrothed; the announcement of the boy-forerunner respecting the son of the 
Virgin, and his leaping in the womb on account of what was foreseen; the songs 
of the angels over Him that was born; the glad tidings announced to the 
shepherds; the fear of Herod lest his kingdom should be taken from him; the 
command to slay the infants; the removal into Egypt, and the return from that 
country to the same region; the infant swaddling-bands; the human registration; 
the nourishing by means of milk; the name of father given to Him who did not 
beget; the manger because there was not room [elsewhere]; no human preparation 
[for the Child]; the gradual growth, human speech, hunger, thirst, journeyings, 
weariness; the offering of sacrifices and then also circumcision, baptism; the 
voice of God over Him that was baptized, as to who He was and whence [He had 
come]; the testimony of the Spirit and the Father from above; the voice of John 
the prophet when it signified the passion by the appellation of "the Lamb;" the 
performance of divers miracles, manifold healings; the rebuke of the Lord ruling 
both the sea and the winds; evil spirits expelled; thou thyself subjected to 
torture, and, when afflicted by the power of Him who had been manifested, not 
having it in thy power to do anything. 
<H2 align=center>Chapter 9 </H2>
<H3 align=center>Continuation: Ignorance Of Satan </H3>
<P align=left>Seeing these things, thou wast in utter perplexity. And thou wast 
ignorant that it was a virgin that should bring forth; but the angels(1) song of 
praise struck thee with astonishment, as well as the adoration of the Magi, and 
the appearance of the star. Thou didst revert to thy state of [wilful] 
ignorance, because all the circumstances seemed to thee trifling; for thou didst 
deem the swaddling-bands, the circumcision, and the nourishment by means of milk 
contemptible: these things appeared to thee unworthy of God. Again, thou didst 
behold a man who remained forty days and nights without tasting human food, 
along with ministering gels at whose presence thou didst shudder, when first of 
all thou hadst seen Him baptized as a common man, and knewest not the reason 
thereof. But after His [lengthened] fast thou didst again assume thy wonted 
audacity, and didst tempt Him when hungry, as if He had been an ordinary man, 
not knowing who He was. For thou saidst, "If thou be the Son of God, command 
that these stones be made bread." Now, this expression, "If thou be the Son," is 
an indication of ignorance. For if thou hadst possessed real knowledge, thou 
wouldst have understood that the Creator can with equal ease both create what 
does not exist, and change that which already has a being. And thou temptedst by 
means of hunger Him who nourisheth all that require food. And thou temptedst the 
very "Lord of glory," forgetting in thy malevolence that "man shall not live by 
bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God." For if 
thou hadst known that He was the Son of God, thou wouldst also have understood 
that He who had kept his body from feeling any want for forty days and as many 
nights, could have also done the same for ever. Why, then, does He suffer 
hunger? In order to prove that He had assumed a body subject to the same 
feelings as those of ordinary men. By the first fact He showed that He was God, 
and by the second that He was also man. 
<H2 align=center>Chapter 10 </H2>
<H3 align=center>Continuation: Audacity Of Satan </H3>
<P align=left>Darest thou, then, who didst fall "as lightning from the very 
highest glory, to say to the Lord, "Cast thyself down from hence [to Him] to 
whom the things that are not are reckoned as if they were,( and to provoke to a 
display of vainglory Him that was free from all ostentation? And didst thou 
pretend to read in Scripture concerning Him: "For He hath given His angels 
charge concerning Thee, and in their hands they shall bear Thee up, lest thou 
shouldest dash Thy foot against a stone?" At the same time thou didst pretend to 
be ignorant of the rest, furtively concealing what [the Scripture] predicted 
concerning thee and thy servants: "Thou shalt tread upon the adder and the 
basilisk; the lion and the dragon shall thou trample under foot." 
<H2 align=center>Chapter 11 </H2>
<H3 align=center>Continuation: Audacity Of Satan </H3>
<P align=left>If, therefore, thou art trodden down under the feet of the Lord, 
how dost thou tempt Him that cannot be tempted, forgetting that precept of the 
lawgiver, "Thou shall not tempt the Lord thy God?" Yea, thou even darest, most 
accursed one, to appropriate the works of God to thyself, and to declare that 
the dominion over these was delivered to thee. And thou dost set forth thine own 
fall as an example to the Lord, and dost promise to give Him what is really His 
own, if He would fall down and worship thee. And how didst thou not shudder, O 
thou spirit more wicked through thy malevolence than all other wicked spirits, 
to utter such words against the Lord? Through thine appetite was thou overcome, 
and through thy vainglory wast thou brought to dishonour: through avarice and 
ambition dost thou [now] draw on [others] to ungodliness. Thou, O Belial, 
dragon, apostate, crooked serpent, rebel against God, outcast from Christ, alien 
from the Holy Spirit, exile from the ranks of the angels, reviler of the laws of 
God, enemy of all that is lawful, who didst rise up against the first-formed of 
men, and didst drive forth [from obedience to] the commandment [of God] those 
who had in no respect injured thee; thou who didst raise up against Abel the 
murderous Cain; thou who didst take arms against Job: dost thou say to the Lord, 
"If Thou wilt fall down and worship me?" Oh what audacity! Oh what madness! Thou 
runaway slave, thou incorrigible slave, dost thou rebel against the good Lord? 
Dost thou say to so great a Lord, the God of all that either the mind or the 
senses can perceive, "If Thou wilt fall down and worship me?" 
<H2 align=center>Chapter 12 </H2>
<H3 align=center>The Meek Reply Of Christ </H3>
<P align=left>But the Lord is long-suffering, and does not reduce to nothing him 
who in his ignorance dares [to utter] such words, but meekly replies, "Get thee 
hence, Satan.'' He does not say, "Get thee behind Me," for it is not possible 
that he should be converted; but, "Begone, Satan," to the course which thou hast 
chosen. "Begone" to those things to which, through thy malevolence, thou hast 
been called. For I know Who I am, and by Whom I have been sent, and Whom it 
behoves Me to worship. For "thou shall worship the Lord thy God, and Him only 
shalt thou serve." I know the one [God]; I am acquainted with the only [Lord] 
from whom thou hast become an apostate. I am not an enemy of God; I acknowledge 
His pre-eminence; I know the Father, who is the author of my generation. 
<H2 align=center>Chapter 13 </H2>
<H3 align=center>Various Exhorations And Directions </H3>
<P align=left>These things, brethren, out of the affection which I entertain for 
you, I have felt compelled to write, exhorting you with a view to the glory of 
God, not as if I were a person of any consequence, but simply as a brother. Be 
ye subject to the bishop, to the presbyters, and to the deacons. Love one 
another in the Lord, as being the images of God. Take heed, ye husbands, that ye 
love your wives as your own members. Ye wives also, love your husbands, as being 
one with them in virtue of your union. If any one lives in chastity or 
continence, let him not be lifted up, lest he lose his reward. Do not lightly 
esteem the festivals. Despise not the period of forty days, for it comprises an 
imitation of the conduct of the Lord. After the week of the passion, do not 
neglect to fast on the fourth and sixth days, distributing at the same time of 
thine abundance to the poor. If any one fasts on the Lord's Day or on the 
Sabbath, except on the paschal Sabbath only, he is a murderer of Christ. 
<H2 align=center>Chapter 14 </H2>
<H3 align=center>Farewells And Cautions </H3>
<P align=left>Let your prayers be extended to the Church of Antioch, whence also 
I as a prisoner am being led to Rome. I salute the holy bishop Polycarp; I 
salute the holy bishop Vitalius, and the sacred presbytery, and my 
fellow-servants the deacons; in whose stead may my soul be found. Once more I 
bid farewell to the bishop, and to the presbyters in the Lord. If any one 
celebrates the passover along with the Jews, or receives the emblems of their 
feast, he is a partaker with those that killed the Lord and His apostles. 
<H2 align=center>Chapter 15 </H2>
<H3 align=center>Salutations And Conclusion </H3>
<P align=left>Philo and Agathopus the deacons salute you. I salute the company 
of virgins, and the order of widows; of whom may I have joy! I salute the people 
of the Lord, from the least unto the greatest. I have sent you this letter 
through Euphanius the reader, a man honoured of God, and very faithful, 
happening to meet with him at Rhegium, just as he was going on board ship. 
Remember my bonds that I may be made perfect in Christ. Fare ye well in the 
flesh, the soul, and the spirit, while ye think of things perfect, and turn 
yourselves away from the workers of iniquity, who corrupt the word of truth, and 
are strengthened inwardly by the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ.
