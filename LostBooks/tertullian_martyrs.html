<P align=center><BIG>TO THE MARTYRS</BIG> 
<P align=center><BIG>by Tertullian</BIG> 
<P align=center><BIG></BIG>
<P align=center><BIG>Chapter 1</BIG> 
<P align=center><BIG></BIG>
<P align=left>Blessed martyrs elect, along with the nourishment for the body 
which our Lady Mother the Church from her breast, as well as individual brethren 
from their private resources, furnish you in prison, accept also from me some 
offering that will contribute to the sustenance of the spirit. For it is<SMALL> 
</SMALL>not good that the flesh be feasted while the spirit goes hungry. Indeed, 
if<SMALL> </SMALL>care is bestowed on that which is weak, there is all the more 
reason not to neglect that which is still weaker. 
<P align=left>Not that I am specially entitled to exhort you. Yet, even the 
most<SMALL> </SMALL>accomplished gladiators are spurred on not only by their 
trainers and<SMALL> </SMALL>managers but also from afar by people inexperienced 
in this art and by all<SMALL> </SMALL>who choose, without the slightest need for 
it, with the result that hints<SMALL> </SMALL>issuing from the crowd have often 
proved profitable for them. 
<P align=left>In the first place, then, O blessed, 'do not grieve the Holy 
Spirit who has entered prison with you. For, if He had not accompanied you there 
in your present trial, you would not be there today. See to it, therefore, that 
He remain with you there and so lead you out of that place to the Lord. 
<P align=left>Indeed, the prison is the Devil's house too, where he keeps his 
household. But you have come to the prison for the very purpose of trampling 
upon him right in his own house. For you have engaged him in battle already 
outside the prison and trampled him underfoot. &nbsp; 
<P align=left>Let him, therefore, not say: 'Now that they are in my domain, I 
will tempt them with base hatreds, with defections or dissensions among 
themselves.' Let him flee from your presence, and let him, coiled and numb, like 
a snake that is driven out by charms or smoke, hide away in the depths of his 
den. Do not allow him the good fortune in his own kingdom of setting you against 
one another, but let him find you fortified by the arms of peace among 
yourselves, because peace among yourselves means war with him. 
<P align=left>Some, not able to find this peace in the Church, are accustomed to 
seek it from the martyrs in prison. For this reason, too, then, you ought to 
possess, cherish and preserve it among yourselves that you may perhaps be able 
to bestow it upon others also. 
<P align=left>
<P align=center>Chapter 2 
<P align=left>
<P align=left>Other attachments, equally burdensome to the spirit, may have 
accompanied you to the prison gate; so far your relatives, too, may have 
escorted you. From that very moment on you have been separated from the very 
world. How much more, then, from its spirit and its ways and doings? &nbsp;Nor 
let this separation from the world trouble you. For, if we reflect that it is 
the very world that is more truly a prison, we shall realize that you have left 
a prison rather than entered one. &nbsp; 
<P align=left>The world holds the greater darkness, blinding men's hearts. The 
world puts on the heavier chains, fettering the very souls of men. The world 
breathes forth the fouler impurities--human lusts. &nbsp; 
<P align=left>Finally, the world contains the larger number of criminals, 
namely, the entire human race. In fact, it awaits sentence not from the 
proconsul but from God. 
<P align=left>Wherefore, O blessed consider yourselves as having been 
transferred from prison to what we may call a place of safety. Darkness is 
there, but you are light; fetters are there, but you are free before God. It 
breathes forth a foul smell, but you are an odor of sweetness. There the judge 
is expected at every moment, but you are going to pass sentence upon the judges 
themselves. 
<P align=left>There sadness may come upon the man who sighs for the pleasures of 
the world The Christian, however even when he is outside the prison, has 
renounced the world and, when in prison, even prison itself. It does not matter 
what part of the world you are in, you who are apart from the world. 
<P align=left>And if you have missed some of the enjoyments of life, remember 
that it is the way of business to suffer one losses in order to make larger 
profits. &nbsp;I say nothing yet about the reward to which God invites the 
martyrs. &nbsp;Meanwhile, let us compare the life in the world with that in 
prison to see if the spirit does not gain more in prison than the flesh loses 
there. 
<P align=left>In fact, owing to the solicitude of the Church and the charity of 
the brethren, the flesh does not miss there what it ought to have, while, in 
addition, the spirit obtains what is always beneficial to the faith: you do not 
look at strange gods; you do not chance upon their images; you do not, even by 
mere physical contact, participate in heathen holidays; you are not plagued by 
the foul fumes of the sacrificial banquets, not tormented by the noise of the 
spectacles, nor by the atrocity or frenzy or shamelessness of those taking part 
in the celebrations; your eyes do not fall on houses of lewdness; you are free 
from inducements to sin, from temptations, from unholy reminiscences, free, 
indeed, even from persecution. 
<P align=left>The prison now offers to the Christian what the desert once gave 
to the Prophets. Our Lord Himself quite often spent time in solitude to pray 
there more freely, to be there away from the world. In fact, it was in a 
secluded place that He manifested His glory to His disciples. Let us drop the 
name 'prison' and call it a place of seclusion. 
<P align=left>Though the body is confined, though the flesh is detained, there 
is nothing that is not open to the spirit. In spirit wander about, in spirit 
take a walk, setting before yourselves not shady promenades and long porticoes 
but that path which leads to God. As often as you walk that path, you will not 
be in prison. 
<P align=left>The leg does not feel the fetter when the spirit is in heaven. The 
spirit carries about the whole man and brings him wherever he wishes. And where 
your heart is, there will your treasure be also. There, then, let our heart be 
where we would have our treasure. 
<P align=left>
<P align=center>CHAPTER 3 
<P align=left>
<P align=left>Granted now, O blessed, that even to Christians the prison is 
unpleasant--yet, we were called to the service in the army of the living God in 
the very moment when we gave response to the words of the sacramental oath. No 
soldier goes out to war encumbered with luxuries, nor does he march to the line 
of battle from the sleeping chamber, but from light and cramped tents where 
every kind of austerity, discomfort, and inconvenience is experienced. 
<P align=left>Even in time of peace soldiers are toughened to warfare by toils 
and hardships: by marching in arms, by practicing swift maneuvers in the field, 
by digging a trench, by joining closely together to form a tortoise-shield. 
&nbsp;Everything is set in sweating toil, lest bodies and minds be frightened at 
having to pass from shade to sunshine, from sunshine to icy cold, from the tunic 
to the breastplate, from hushed silence to the warcry, from rest to the din of 
battle. 
<P align=left>In like manner, O blessed, consider whatever is hard in your 
present situation as an exercise of your powers of mind and body. You are about 
to enter a noble contest in which the living God acts the part of superintendent 
and the Holy Spirit is your trainer, a contest whose crown is eternity, whose 
prize is angelic nature, citizenship in heaven and glory for ever and ever. 
<P align=left>And so your Master, Jesus Christ, who has anointed you with His 
Spirit and has brought you to this training ground, has resolved, before the day 
of the contest, to take you from a softer way of life to a harsher treatment 
that your strength may be increased. For athletes, too, are set apart for more 
rigid training that they may apply themselves to the building up of their 
physical strength. They are kept from lavish living, from more tempting dishes, 
from more pleasurable drinks. They are urged on, they are subjected to torturing 
toils, they are worn out: the more strenuously they have exerted themselves, the 
greater is their hope of victory. 
<P align=left>And they do this, says the Apostle, to win a perishable crown. We 
who are about to win an eternal one recognize in the prison our training ground, 
that we may be led forth to the actual contest before the seat of the presiding 
judge well practiced in all hardships, because strength is built up by 
austerity, but destroyed by softness. 
<P align=left>
<P align=center>CHAPTER 4 
<P align=left>
<P align=left>We know from our Lord's teaching that, while the spirit is 
willing, the flesh is weak. Let us, however, not derive delusive gratification 
from the Lord's acknowledgment of the weakness of the flesh. For it was on 
purpose that He first declared the spirit willing: He wanted to show which of 
the two ought to be subject to the other, that is to say, that the flesh should 
be submissive to the spirit, the weaker to the stronger, so that the former may 
draw strength from the latter. 
<P align=left>Let the spirit converse with the flesh on their common salvation, 
no longer thinking about the hardships of prison but, rather, about the struggle 
of the actual contest. The flesh will perhaps fear the heavy sword and the lofty 
cross and the wild beasts mad with rage and the most terrible punishment of 
all--death by fire--and, finally, all the executioner's cunning during the 
torture. 
<P align=left>But let the spirit present to both itself and the flesh the other 
side of the picture: granted, these sufferings are grievous, yet many have borne 
them patiently nay, have even sought them on their own accord for the sake of 
fame and glory; and this is true not only of men but also of women so that you, 
too, O blessed women may be worthy of your sex. 
<P align=left>It would lead me too far were I to enumerate each one of those 
who, led by the impulse of their own mind put an end to their lives by the 
sword. &nbsp;Among women there is the well-known instance of Lucretia. &nbsp;A 
victim of &nbsp;violence, she stabbed herself in the presence of her kinsfolk to 
gain glory for her chastity. &nbsp;Mucius burnt his right hand on the altar that 
his fair fame might include this deed. 
<P align=left>Nor did the philosophers act less courageously: Heraclitus, for 
instance, who put an end to his life by smearing himself with cow dung ; 
Empedocles, too, who leaped down into the fires of Mt. Etna; and Peregrinus who 
not long ago threw himself upon a funeral pile. Why, even women have despised 
the flames: Dido did so in order not to be forced to marry after the departure 
of the man she had loved most dearly; the wife of Hasdrubal, too, with Carthage 
in flames, cast herself along with her children into the fire that was 
destroying her native city, that she might not see her husband a suppliant at 
Scipio's feet. 
<P align=left>Regulus, a Roman general, was taken prisoner by the Carthaginians, 
but refused to be the only Roman exchanged for a large number of Carthaginian 
captives. &nbsp;He preferred to be returned to the enemy, and, crammed into a 
kind of chest, suffered as many crucifixions as nails were driven in from the 
outside in all directions to pierce him. &nbsp;A woman voluntarily sought out 
wild beasts, namely, vipers, serpents more horrible than either bull or bear, 
which Cleopatra let loose upon herself as not to fall into the hands of the 
enemy. 
<P align=left>You may object: 'But the fear of death is not so great as the fear 
of torture.' &nbsp;Did the Athenian courtesan yield on that account to the 
executioner? &nbsp;For, being privy to a conspiracy, she was subjected to 
torture by the tyrant. &nbsp;But she did not betray her fellow conspirators, and 
at last bit off her own tongue and spat it into the tyrant's face to let him 
know that torments, however prolonged, could achieve nothing against her. 
<P align=left>Everybody knows that to this day the most important festival of 
the Lacedaemonians is the "diamastigosis," that is, The Whipping. In this sacred 
rite all the noble youth are scourged with whips before the altar, while their 
parents and kinsfolk stand by and exhort them to perseverance. &nbsp;For they 
regard it as a mark of greater distinction and glory if the soul rather than the 
body has submitted to the stripes. 
<P align=left>Therefore, if earthly glory accruing from strength of body and 
soul is valued so highly that one despises sword, fire, piercing with nails, 
wild beasts and tortures for the reward of human praise, then I may say the 
sufferings you endure are but trifling in comparison with the heavenly glory and 
divine reward. If the bead made of glass is rated so highly, how much must the 
true pearl be worth? Who, therefore, does not most gladly spend as much for the 
true as others spend for the false? 
<P align=left>
<P align=center>CHAPTER 5 
<P align=left>
<P align=left>I omit here an account of the motive of glory. For inordinate 
ambition among men as well as a certain morbidity of mind have already set at 
naught all the cruel and torturing contests mentioned above. How many of the 
leisure class are urged by an excessive love of arms to become gladiators? 
&nbsp;Surely it is from vanity that they descend to the wild beasts in the very 
arena, and think themselves more handsome because of the bites and scars. 
&nbsp;Some have even hired themselves out to tests by fire, with the result that 
they ran a certain distance in a burning tunic. Others have pranced up and down 
amid the bullwhips of the animal-baiters, unflinchingly exposing their 
shoulders. 
<P align=left>All this, O blessed, the Lord tolerates in the world for good 
reason, that is, for the sake of encouraging us in the present moment and of 
confounding us on that final day, if we have recoiled from suffering for the 
truth unto salvation what others have pursued out of vanity unto perdition. 
<P align=left>
<P align=center>CHAPTER 6 
<P align=left>
<P align=left>Let us, however, no longer talk about those examples of 
perseverance proceeding from inordinate ambition. Let us, rather, turn to a 
simple contemplation of man's ordinary lot so that, if we ever have to undergo 
such trials with fortitude, we may also learn from those misfortunes which 
sometimes even befall unwilling victims. For how often have people been burned 
to death in conflagrations! How often have wild beasts devoured men either in 
the forests or in the heart of cities after escaping from their cages! How many 
have been slain by the sword of robbers! How many have even suffered the death 
of the cross at the hands of enemies, after having been tortured first and, 
indeed, treated with every kind of insult! 
<P align=left>Furthermore, many a man is able to suffer in the cause of a mere 
human being what he hesitates to suffer in the cause of God. To this fact, 
indeed, our present days may bear witness. How many prominent persons have met 
with death in the cause of a man, though such a fate seemed most unlikely in 
view of their birth and their rank, their physical condition and their age! 
Death came to them either from him, if they had opposed him, or from his 
enemies, if they had sided with him.
