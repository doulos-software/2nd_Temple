<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>1. In the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar, <br>
2. [Pontius Pilatus being the Governor of Judaea,] Jesus came down to Capernaum,<br>
a city in Galilee, and was <br>
3. teaching on the sabbath days : and they were astonished at his doctrine : <br>
for his word was in authority.<br>
4. And in the synagogue there was a man which had a spirit of an unclean demon, and<br>
he cried out with a loud<br>
5. voice, Saying, &quot;let <em>us</em> alone ; what have we to do with thee, Jesus? art
thou <br>
come to destroy us? I know thee<br>
6. who thou art : the Holy One of God.&quot; And Jesus rebuked him, saying ; &quot;Hold
thy peace, <br>
and come out of him.&quot; And when the demon had thrown him into the midst,<br>
7. he came out of him, having done no hurt. And amazement came upon all, and they spake
together <br>
saying to one another, what is this word? For in authority and power he commandeth <br>
the unclean spirits,<br>
8. and they come out. And a rumour of him went out into every place of the country round
about, <br>
9. And he arose out of the synagogue, and entered into the house of Simon.<br>
And Simon`s mother in law was taken with a great fever : and they besought him for her.<br>
10. And he stood over her, and rebuked the fever : and it left her : and immidately she
arose and <br>
ministered unto them.<br>
11. And he came to Nazareth, and went into the <br>
12. synagogue [on the Sabbath day] and sat down. And the eyes of all in the synagogue
fastened on<br>
him,<br>
13-14. And he began to speak to them; and all wondered <br>
15. at the words which proceedeth from his mouth. And he said unto them, &quot; Ye will
surely say unto me this <br>
parable, <em>Physician, heal thyself</em>; whatsoever we have <br>
16. heard done at Capernaum, do also here. But I tell you of a truth, many widows were in
Israel in the days of Elijah<br>
, when the heaven was shut up three years and six months,<br>
17. when great famine occured throughout all the land: and unto none of them was Elijah
sent, but only to Sarepta , <br>
18. a <em>city</em> of Sidon, unto a woman <em>that was</em> a widow. And many lepers were
in Israel <br>
in the time of Elisha the prophet : and none of them was cleansed, but only <br>
19. Naaman the syrian&quot;. And they were all filled with wrath <br>
20. in the synagogue, when they heard these things, and rose up, and thrust him out of the
city, and led him <br>
unto the brow of the hill whereon their city was built, to cast <br>
21. him down headlong. But he passing through the midst of them went his way.<br>
22. And when the sun was setting, all as many as had any sick with divers diseases brought
them unto him; <br>
and he laid his hands on every one of them, and healed them. <br>
23. And demons also came out of many, crying out, saying, &quot;Thou art Son of God&quot;
and he rebuked <em>them</em><br>
suffered them not to speak; for they knew that he was the Christ.<br>
24. And when it was day, he departed and went into a desert place: and the multitudes
sought him, and came unto <br>
him, and stayed him, that he should not depart from <br>
25. them. And he said unto them, &quot;I must announce as good tidings the kingdom of God
to the other cities also: <br>
for therefore am i sent.<br>
26. And he was preaching in the synagogues of Galilee.<br>

<p>&nbsp; 

<dl>
  <dd>Now it came to pass, that, as the multitude pressed upn him to hear the word of God, he
    was standing by <br>
    2. </dd>
  <dd>the lake of Gennesaret, and saw two boats standing by the lake: but the fdishermen were
    gone out of them,<br>
    3. </dd>
  <dd>and were washing <em>their</em> nets. And he entered into one of the boats, which was
    Simon`s , and asked<br>
  </dd>
  <dd>him to thrust out a litle from land. And he sat down, and <br>
    4. </dd>
  <dd>taught the multitudes out of the boat. Now when he had left speaking, he said unto
    Simon, &quot;Put put into the <br>
    5. </dd>
  <dd>deep, and let down your nets a draught&quot;. And Simon answering said unto him,
    &quot;Master, we have toiled all the night<br>
  </dd>
  <dd>, and taken nothing ; but at thy word I will let down<br>
    6. </dd>
  <dd>the net.&quot; When they had this done, they inclosed a <br>
    7. </dd>
  <dd>great multitude of fishes: and their nets were breaking. And they beckoned unto <em>their</em>
    partners <br>
  </dd>
  <dd>, in the other boat, that they should come and help them out. And they came, and <br>
    8. </dd>
  <dd>filled both the boats, so that they began to sink. When Simon Peter saw <em>it</em>, he
    fell down at Jesus` <br>
  </dd>
  <dd>knees, saying,<br>
    9. </dd>
  <dd>&quot;Depart from me; for I am a sinful man , O Lord.&quot; For amazement overcame him,
    and all that were with him, at <br>
    10. </dd>
  <dd>the draught of the fishes which they had taken: which were partners with Simon. And
    Jesus said unto Simon, <br>
  </dd>
  <dd>&quot;fear not ; from henceforth thou shalt be taking men<br>
    11. </dd>
  <dd>alive.&quot; And when they had brought their boats to land, they left all, and followed
    him.<br>
    12. </dd>
  <dd>And it came to pass, when he was in one of the cities, behold a man full of leprosy: <br>
    who seeing Jesus fell on <em>his</em> face, and besought him, saying ; &quot;Lord, if thou
    wilt, thou <br>
    13. </dd>
  <dd>canst make me clean.&quot; And he put forth <em>his</em> hand, and touched him, saying, <br>
  </dd>
  <dd>&quot; I will : be thou cleansed&quot; And<br>
    14. </dd>
  <dd>immediately the leprosy departed from the man. And he charged him<br>
  </dd>
  <dd>to tell no man; but go, and shew thyself to the priest, and offer for thy cleansing,
    according as Moses<br>
    15. </dd>
  <dd>commanded, that this may be a testimony to you. But so much the more went there a fame
    abroad of <br>
  </dd>
  <dd>him: and many multitidues came together to hear, and to be healed <br>
    16. </dd>
  <dd>by him for their infirmities. And he himself was withdrawing in the wilderness, praying.<br>
    17. </dd>
  <dd>And it came to pass on one of the days that he was teaching, and there were Pharisees
    and doctors <br>
  </dd>
  <dd>of the law sitting vtm which were come out of every village of Galilee, Judaea, and
    Jerusalem: and the <br>
  </dd>
  <dd>power of the<br>
    18. </dd>
  <dd>Lord was <em>with Him</em> toheal them. And behold, men brought in a bed a man that was <br>
  </dd>
  <dd>palsied; and they sought <br>
    19. </dd>
  <dd>to bring him in, and to lay <em>him</em> before him. And not finding by what <em>way</em>
    they might <br>
  </dd>
  <dd>bring him in because of the multitude, they went up to the housetop, and let him down
    through the tiles <br>
  </dd>
  <dd>with <em>his</em> couch into the midst before <br>
    20. </dd>
  <dd>Jesus. And seeing their faith, he said unto him , &quot;Man, thy <br>
    21. </dd>
  <dd>sins are forgiven thee.&quot; And the scribes and the Pharisees began to reason, saying,
    &quot;Who is this which<br>
  </dd>
  <dd>speaketh blasphemies? Who can forgive sin, but God alone?<br>
    22. </dd>
  <dd>But Jesus perceiving their reasoning answered and said unto them, &quot;What reasen ye
    in your hearts?<br>
    23. </dd>
  <dd>Whether is easier, to say, Thy sins are forgiven thee ; or <br>
    24. </dd>
  <dd>to say ; Rise up and walk? But that ye may know that the Son of man hath authority upon
    earth to forgive sins<br>
  </dd>
  <dd>(he said unto the palsied man) I say unto thee, Arise<br>
    25. </dd>
  <dd>and take up they couch, and go to thine house. And immediately he rose up before them,
    and took up that <br>
  </dd>
  <dd>whereon he lay, and departed to his house, glorifying<br>
    26. </dd>
  <dd>God. And amazement took hold on all, and they glorified God, and were filled with fear,
    saying, &quot;We have<br>
  </dd>
  <dd>seen strange things today&quot;.<br>
    27. </dd>
  <dd>And after these things he went forth, and saw a publican, named Levi, sitting at the
    place of toll : and he<br>
    28. </dd>
  <dd>said unto him, &quot;Follow me.&quot; And he left all, rose up, and <br>
    29. </dd>
  <dd>followed him. And Levi made him a great feast in his hourse : and there was a great
    company of publicans and<br>
    30. </dd>
  <dd>of others that were reclining with them. And their scribes and the Pharisees murmured
    against his disciples,<br>
    30. </dd>
  <dd>saying, &quot;Why do ye year and drink with publicans and <br>
    31. </dd>
  <dd>sinners?&quot; And Jesus answering said unto them, &quot;They that are whole have no
    need of a physiciian ; but they<br>
    32. </dd>
  <dd>that are sick. I am not come to call the righteous, but <br>
    33. </dd>
  <dd>sinners to repentance. And they said unto him, &quot;Why do the disciples of John fast
    often, and make prayers, <br>
  </dd>
  <dd>and likewise the <em>disciples</em> of the Pharisees; but thine eat and <br>
    34. </dd>
  <dd>drink? And he said unto them, &quot;Can ye make the sons of the bridal chamber fast,
    while the bridegroom is with<br>
    35. </dd>
  <dd>them? But the days will come; and when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them,
    then will they fast in<br>
    36. </dd>
  <dd>those days.&quot; And he spake also a parable unto them; &quot;No man putteth a piece of
    new garment upon an old <br>
  </dd>
  <dd>garment; else both the new maketh a rent, and the piece that was <em>taken</em> out of
    the new <br>
  </dd>
  <dd>agreeth not with the<br>
    37. </dd>
  <dd>old. And no man puttteth new wine into old wine-skins, else the new wine will burst the
    skins; and itself will be <br>
    38. </dd>
  <dd>spilled, and the skins will perish. But new wine must be put into new wine-skins, and
    both are preserved.<br>
    39. </dd>
  <dd>No man also having drunk old <em>wine</em> straigtway desireth new ; for he saith, the
    old is better.<br>
    <p align="center"><font size="+3">III.</font> </p>
  </dd>
  <dd>And it came to pass on the second sabbath after the first, that he was going through the
    corn fields : and his <br>
  </dd>
  <dd>disciples plucked the ears of cornm and did eat, rubbing <em>them</em> in <br>
    2. </dd>
  <dd>their hands. And certain of the Pharisees said unto them, &quot;Why do ye that which is
    not lawful to do <br>
    3. </dd>
  <dd>on the sabbath day?&quot; And Jesus answering them, said, &quot;Have ye not read even
    this what David did, when<br>
  </dd>
  <dd>himself was<br>
    4. </dd>
  <dd>an hungered, and they which were with him ; how they went into the house of God, and did
    take and eat <br>
  </dd>
  <dd>the shewbread, and gave also to them that were with him ; which it is not lawful to eat
    but for the priests alone?&quot;<br>
    5. </dd>
  <dd>And he said unto them, &quot;That the Son of man is Lord even of the sabbath&quot;<br>
    6. </dd>
  <dd>And it came to pass also on another Sabbath, that he entered into the synagogue and
    taught; and there were a <br>
    7. </dd>
  <dd>a man there and his right hand was withered. And the scribes and Pharisees watched him,
    whether he would <br>
  </dd>
  <dd>heal on the sabbath day; that they might find an <br>
    8. </dd>
  <dd>accusation against him. But he knew their reasonings, and said to the man which had the
    withered man, &quot;Rise up <br>
  </dd>
  <dd>, and stand forth in the midst. And he rose and stood<br>
    9. </dd>
  <dd>forth. Then said Jesus unto them, &quot;I will ask you something; Is it lawful on the
    sabbath to do good<br>
    10. </dd>
  <dd>or to do evil? To save life, or to destroy <em>it</em>?&quot; And looking round about
    upon them all, he said unto the <br>
  </dd>
  <dd>man, &quot;stretch forth thy hand.&quot; and he did so : and his hand was<br>
    11. </dd>
  <dd>restored as the other. And they were filled with madness; and commanded one with another
    what they <br>
  </dd>
  <dd>might do to Jesus.<br>
    12. </dd>
  <dd>And it came to pass in those days, that he went out into the mountains to pray, and was
    passing the whole night<br>
    13. </dd>
  <dd>in prayer to God. And when it was day, he called <em>unto him</em> his disciples: and he
    chose <br>
  </dd>
  <dd>from them twelve.<br>
    14. </dd>
  <dd>whom he also named ; apostles ; Simon (whom was also named Peter), and Andrew his
    brother, James and <br>
  </dd>
  <dd>John, Phillip <br>
    15. </dd>
  <dd>and Bartholomew, Matthew and Thomas, James the <em>son</em> <br>
    16. </dd>
  <dd>of Alphaeas, and Simon whom they called Zelotes, and Judas <em>the brother</em> of
    James, and Judas<br>
  </dd>
  <dd>Iscarioth , which also became a <br>
    17. </dd>
  <dd>traitor. And he came down among them, and stood on a level place, and the multitude of
    his disciples, and a <br>
  </dd>
  <dd>great number of people out of all Judaea and Jerusalem, and from the sea coast of Tyre
    and Sidon, which <br>
  </dd>
  <dd>came to hear<br>
    18. </dd>
  <dd>him, and to be healed of their diseases; and they that were troubled by unclean spirits:
    and they were healed.<br>
    19. </dd>
  <dd>And the whole multitude sought to touch him : for power went out of him , and healed <em>them</em>
    all.<br>
    20. </dd>
  <dd>And he lifted up his eyes on his disciples, and said:<br>
  </dd>
  <dd>&quot;Blessed <em>are ye</em> poor: for your`s is the kingdom of God.<br>
    21. </dd>
  <dd>Blessed <em>are ye</em> that hunger now : for ye shall be filled.<br>
  </dd>
  <dd>Blessed <em>are ye</em> that weep now : for ye shall laught.<br>
    22. </dd>
  <dd>Blessed <em>are ye</em>, when men shall hate you, and when they <br>
  </dd>
  <dd>shall separate you <em>from their company</em>, and shall reproach <br>
  </dd>
  <dd><em>you</em>, and cast out your name as evil, for the Son of man`s <br>
    23. </dd>
  <dd>sake. Rejoice ye in that day, and leap <em>for you</em> : for , behold, your reward <em>is</em>
  </dd>
  <dd>great in heaven: for according to <br>
    24. </dd>
  <dd>these things did their fathers unto the prophets. But woe unto you that are rich! for ye
    have consolation<br>
    25. </dd>
  <dd>in full. Woe unto you that are full! for ye shall hunger. Woe unto you that laugh now!
    for ye <br>
    26. </dd>
  <dd>shall mourn and weep. Woe unto you, when all men shall speak well of you! for according
    to these things<br>
  </dd>
  <dd>did their fathers to the false prophets.<br>
    27. </dd>
  <dd>But I say unto you that hear, Love your enemies, do <br>
    28. </dd>
  <dd>good to them which hate you, bless them that curse you, <br>
    29. </dd>
  <dd>and pray for them which despitefully use you.Unto him that smiteth thee on the <em>one</em>
    cheek, <br>
  </dd>
  <dd>offer also the other ; and from him that taketh away thy cloke, withhold <br>
    30. </dd>
  <dd>not thy coat also. Give every man that asketh of thee: and of him that taketh away thy
    goods ask <em>them</em>.<br>
    31. </dd>
  <dd>not again. and as ye would that men should do to you, <br>
    32. </dd>
  <dd>do ye also to them likewise. And if ye love them which love you, what thank have ye? for
    sinners <br>
  </dd>
  <dd>also love those <br>
    33. </dd>
  <dd>that love them. And if ye do good to them which do good to you, what thank have ye? for
    sinners <br>
  </dd>
  <dd>also do <br>
    34. </dd>
  <dd>the same. And if ye lend to <em>them</em> of whom ye hope to receive, what thank have
    ye? for sinners also<br>
  </dd>
  <dd>lend to <br>
    35. </dd>
  <dd>sinners, to receive equal things.But love ye your enemies, and do good, and lend, hoping
    for nothing again : <br>
  </dd>
  <dd>and your reward shall be great , and ye shall be sons of the Highest : for he is kind
    unto the unthankful and <em>to</em><br>
    36. </dd>
  <dd>the evil. Be ye therefore merciful, as your Father also is <br>
    37. </dd>
  <dd>merciful. And Judge not, and ye shall not be judged : condemn not, and ye shall not be
    condemned : <br>
  </dd>
  <dd>release<br>
    38. </dd>
  <dd>and ye shall be released : Give, and it shall be given unto you ; good measure, pressed
    down, and shaken </dd>
  <dd>together, and running over, shall they give into your bosom. For with the same measure
    that ye mete withal<br>
  </dd>
  <dd>it shall be measured to you again.&quot;<br>
    39. </dd>
  <dd>And he spake a parable unto them, &quot;Can the blind lead <br>
    40. </dd>
  <dd>the blind? shall they not both fall into the ditch? The disciple is not above his
    teacher : but every one that is <br>
    41 </dd>
  <dd>perfect shall be as his teacher. And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brothers
    eye, but perceivest <br>
    42. </dd>
  <dd>not the beam that is in thine won eye? Either how canst thou say to thy brother,
    Brother, let me pull the mote <br>
  </dd>
  <dd>that is in thine eye, when thou thyself beholdest not the beam in thine own eye? Thou
    hypocrite, cast out first <br>
  </dd>
  <dd>the beam out of thine own eye, and then shall you see clearly to pull out the mote that
    is in thy brother`s eye!.<br>
    43. </dd>
  <dd>For there is no good tree that maketh corrupt fruit ; nor <br>
    44. </dd>
  <dd>corrupt tree that maketh good fruit. For each tree is known by its fruit. For of thorns
    do they not gather figs <br>
  </dd>
  <dd>, nor of a bramble bush gather they grapes.<br>
    45. </dd>
  <dd>The good man out of the good treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is truely
    good : and the evil man<br>
  </dd>
  <dd>out of the evil treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is evil : for out of the
    abundance of the heart his <br>
    46. </dd>
  <dd>mouth speaketh. And why call ye me, Lord, Lord , and <br>
    47. </dd>
  <dd>do not do the things which I say? Everyone that cometh to me, and heareth my sayings,
    and doeth them, I will<br>
    48. </dd>
  <dd>shew you to whom he is like : He is like a man building a house, who digged and went
    deep, and laid a <br>
  </dd>
  <dd>foundation on the rock : and when the flood arose, the stream beat vehemtly upon the
    house, and had not strenght<br>
  </dd>
  <dd>to shake it: for it was founded upon the <br>
    49. </dd>
  <dd>rock. But he that heareth, and doeth not, is like a man that without a foundation built
    a house upon the earth;<br>
  </dd>
  <dd>against which the stream did beat vehemently, and immediately it fell, and the ruin of
    that house was great. </dd>
  <dd><p align="center"><font size="+3">IV</font> </p>
  </dd>
  <dd>Now when he had completed all his sayings in the ears of the people, he entered into
    Capernaum.<br>
    2. </dd>
  <dd>And a certain centurion`s servant was sick, and going to <br>
    3. </dd>
  <dd>die ; and he was precious unto him. And when he heard of Jesus, he sent unto him elders
    of the Jews<br>
    4. </dd>
  <dd>asking him that he would come and save his servant. And when they came to Jesus, they
    besought <br>
  </dd>
  <dd>him earnestly , saying, That he was worthy for whom he should do this: <br>
    5. </dd>
  <dd>&quot;For he loveth our nation, and he hath built us the <br>
    6. </dd>
  <dd>synagogue&quot;. Then Jesus went with them. And when he was now not far from the house,
    the centurion sent<br>
  </dd>
  <dd>friends to him,saying unto him : &quot;Lord, trouble not thyself; for I am not worthy
    that thou shouldest enter under my roof.<br>
    7. </dd>
  <dd>Wherefore neither thoughtr I myself worthy to come unto thee: but say in a word, and my
    boy shall be healed.<br>
    8. </dd>
  <dd>For I aslo am a man set under authority, having under me soliders, and I say unto this
    one , Go, and he goeth <br>
  </dd>
  <dd>; and to another, Come, and he cometh ; and to my servant , Do <br>
    9. </dd>
  <dd>this, and he doeth <em>it</em>&quot;. And when Jesus heard these things, he marveled at
    him, and turned, and said <br>
  </dd>
  <dd>unto the multitude that followed him, &quot;I say unto you, not even in <br>
    10. </dd>
  <dd>Israel have I found so great faith.&quot; And they that were sent, returned to the
    house, and found the sick servant whole.<br>
    11. </dd>
  <dd>And it came to pass the day after, that he was going into a city called Nain,; and many
    of his disciples were <br>
    12. </dd>
  <dd>going with him, and a great multitude. Now when he came night to the gate of the city,
    behold, a dead man was <br>
  </dd>
  <dd>being carried out, the only son of his mother, and she was a widow : and a considerable
    multitude of the <br>
    13. </dd>
  <dd>city was with her. And when the Lord saw her, he had <br>
    14. </dd>
  <dd>compassion on her, and said unto her, &quot;Weep not.&quot; And he came and touched the
    bier : and they that<br>
  </dd>
  <dd>bare <em>him</em> stood still. And he said, &quot;Young man, I say unto thee,
    Arise!&quot;<br>
    15. </dd>
  <dd>And the <em>dead man</em> sat up, and began to speak. And<br>
    16. </dd>
  <dd>he delivered him to his mother. And fear took hold on all: and they glorified God,
    saying, That a great prophet<br>
  </dd>
  <dd>is risen up among us ; and, That God hath <br>
    17. </dd>
  <dd>visited his people. And this rumour of him went forth in the whole of Judaea, and in all
    region round about.<br>
    18. </dd>
  <dd>And the disciples of John told him of all these <br>
    19. </dd>
  <dd>things. And John calling <em>unto him</em> a certain two of his disciples sent <em>them</em>
    to Jesus, <br>
  </dd>
  <dd>saying, &quot;Art thou he that <br>
    20. </dd>
  <dd>cometh? or are we to look for another?&quot; And when the men were come unto him, they
    said, <br>
  </dd>
  <dd>&quot;John the Baptist hath sent us unto thee, saying ; Art thou he that cometh? <br>
    21. </dd>
  <dd>or are we to look for another?&quot; And in that same hour he cured many infirmities and
    plagues <br>
  </dd>
  <dd>and of evil spirits; <br>
    22. </dd>
  <dd>and unto many blind he gave sight. And Jesus answering said unto them, &quot;Go your
    way, and tell John <br>
  </dd>
  <dd>what things ye have seen and heard : that the blind receive their sight, the lame walk,
    the lepers are cleansed<br>
  </dd>
  <dd>, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, the poor have good tidings<br>
    23. </dd>
  <dd>announced to them. And blessed is <em>he</em>, whosoever shall not be offended in
    me.&quot;<br>
    24. </dd>
  <dd>And when the messengers of John were departed, he began to say unto the multitudes
    concerning John <br>
  </dd>
  <dd>What are ye come into the wilderness to gaze at? A reed <br>
    25. </dd>
  <dd>shaken with the wind? But what are ye come out to see? A man clothed in soft rainment? <br>
  </dd>
  <dd>Behold, they which are in gorgeous apparel, and delicacy, are kings` <br>
    26. </dd>
  <dd>courts. But what are ye come out to see? A Prophet? Yea , I say unto you, and much more
    than a prophet.<br>
    27. </dd>
  <dd>This is <em>he</em>, of whom it is written, &quot;Behold, I send my messenger before thy
    face, which<br>
  </dd>
  <dd>shall prepare thy way <br>
    28. </dd>
  <dd>before thee.&quot; For I say unto you, Among those that are born from women, a greater
    prophet than <br>
  </dd>
  <dd>John the Baptist, there is none : but he that is less in the Kingdom of God <br>
    29. </dd>
  <dd>is greater than he&quot;. And all the people when they heard it, and the publicans,
    justified God, being <br>
  </dd>
  <dd>baptised with <br>
    30. </dd>
  <dd>the baptism of John. But the Pharisees and lawyer rejected the counsel of God unto
    themselves, being not <br>
    31. </dd>
  <dd>baptised of him. And the Lord said, &quot;Whereunto then shall I liken the men of this
    generation? and to what are <br>
    32. </dd>
  <dd>they like? They are like unto children sitting in the marketplace, and calling to one
    another, and saying : <br>
  </dd>
  <dd>, We piped unto you, and ye did not dance, we mourned <br>
    33. </dd>
  <dd>you, and ye did not weep. For John the Baptist is come neither eating bread nor drinking
    wine, and ye say, He<br>
    34. </dd>
  <dd>hath a demon. The Son of man is coming eating and drinking, and ye say, Behold a
    gluttonous man, and a <br>
    35. </dd>
  <dd>winebibber, a friend of publicans and sinners! And wisdom was justified of all her
    children&quot;.<br>
    36. </dd>
  <dd>And one of the Pharisees desired him that he would eat with him. And he went into the
    Pharisee`s house, and <br>
    37. </dd>
  <dd>reclined <em>to meat</em>. And behold, a woman of the city, which was a sinner, when she
    knew that he was <br>
  </dd>
  <dd>reclining in the Pharisee`s house, brought an alabaster box of ointment<br>
    38. </dd>
  <dd>, and stood at his feet behind <em>him</em> weeping, and began to wet his feet with the
    tears, <br>
  </dd>
  <dd>, and did wipe <em>them</em> with the hairs of her head, and kissed his feet, and
    anointed<br>
    39. </dd>
  <dd><em>them</em> with the ointment. Now when the Pharisee which had bidden him saw <em>it</em>,<br>
  </dd>
  <dd>he spake to himself, saying, &quot;This man, if he were a prophet, would have known who
    and what manner <br>
  </dd>
  <dd>manner of woman <em>this is</em> that touched him :<br>
    40. </dd>
  <dd>for she is a sinner. And Jesus answering said unto him, &quot;Simon, I have somewhat to
    say unto thee.&quot;<br>
  </dd>
  <dd>And he saith, <br>
    41. </dd>
  <dd>&quot;Teacher, say on.&quot; &quot;A certain money-lender had two debtors : the one owed
    five hundred denarii, and <br>
    42. </dd>
  <dd>the other fifty. And when they had not whewewith to pay, he forgave them both. Tell me
    therefore, which <br>
    43. </dd>
  <dd>of them will love him more?&quot; Simon answered and said, &quot;I suppose that <em>he</em>,
    to whom he forgave <br>
  </dd>
  <dd>the more.&quot; And he said unto<br>
    44. </dd>
  <dd>him, &quot;Thou hast rightly judged&quot;And he turned to the woman, and said unto
    Simon, &quot;Seest thou this woman?<br>
  </dd>
  <dd>I entered into thine house : water for my feet thou gavest me not : but she hath wetted
    my feet with tears, and <br>
  </dd>
  <dd>wiped<br>
    45. </dd>
  <dd>them with the hairs of her head. A kiss thou gavest me not : but she since the time I
    came hath not ceased <br>
    46. </dd>
  <dd>kissing my feet. My head with oil thou didst not anoint: but this woman hath anointed my
    feet with ointment.<br>
    47. </dd>
  <dd>For the sake of which I say unto thee ; Her sins which are many are forgiven; for she
    loved much : but to <br>
    48. </dd>
  <dd>whom little is forgiven, <em>the same</em> loveth little&quot;. And he<br>
    49. </dd>
  <dd>said unto her, &quot; Thy sins are forgiven.&quot; And they that were reclining with him
    began to say among themselves,<br>
    50. </dd>
  <dd>&quot;Who is this that even forgiveth sins?&quot; And he said to the woman &quot;Thy
    faith has saved thee, go in peace.&quot;<br>
    <p align="center"><strong><font size="+3">V.</font></strong> </p>
  </dd>
  <dd>And it came to pass afterward, that he made his way through city and village, preaching
    and announcing as good <br>
  </dd>
  <dd>tidings the kingdom of God : and the twelve <em>were</em><br>
    2. </dd>
  <dd>with him. And certain women, which had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities, Mary
    called Magdalene, from <br>
    3. </dd>
  <dd>whom seven demons had gone out , and Joannah the wife of Chuza, Herod`s steward, and
    Susanna, and many <br>
  </dd>
  <dd>others, which ministered unto him of their possessions.<br>
    4. </dd>
  <dd>And when a great multitude were coming together, and they of every city were come to
    him, he spake by a <br>
    5. </dd>
  <dd>parable : &quot;The sower went out to sow his seed : and as he sowed, some fell by the
    way side : and it was trodden<br>
    6. </dd>
  <dd>down, and the fowls of the heaven devoured it. And other fell upon the rock, and when
    sprung up, it withered away,<br>
    7. </dd>
  <dd>because it lacked moisture. And other fell in the midst of the thorns ; and the thorns
    sprang up with it, and <br>
    8. </dd>
  <dd>choked it. And other fell on the good ground, and when sprung up, it made fruit and
    hundredfold&quot;. And when he <br>
  </dd>
  <dd>said these things, he cried,&quot; He that hath ears to hear, let him hear!&quot;<br>
    9. </dd>
  <dd>And his disciples asked him, saying, &quot;What might this <br>
    10. </dd>
  <dd>parable be?&quot; And he said, &quot;Unto you it is given to know the mysteries of the
    Kingdom of God: but to the rest <br>
  </dd>
  <dd>in parables; that seeing they may not see, and hearing <br>
    11. </dd>
  <dd>that they may not understand. Now the parable is this : <br>
    12. </dd>
  <dd>The seed is the word of God. Those by the way side are they that hear ; then cometh the
    devil, and taketh <br>
  </dd>
  <dd>away the word from their hearts, lest they should believe and <br>
    13. </dd>
  <dd>be saved. Those on the rock <em>are they</em>, which , when they hear, receive the word
    with joy ; and these <br>
  </dd>
  <dd>have no root, which for a while believe, and in time of temptation fall<br>
    14. </dd>
  <dd>away. And that which fell among thorns, these are they, which, when they have heard ,
    go, and are choked <br>
  </dd>
  <dd>with cares and riches and pleasures of <em>this</em> life , and bring <br>
    15. </dd>
  <dd>no fruit of perfection. But that on the good ground, these are, whoever in an honest and
    good heart, <br>
  </dd>
  <dd>having heard the word, keep hold <em>of it</em>, and bring forth fruit in patience.<br>
    16. </dd>
  <dd>No man, when he hath lighted a lamp, covereth it with a vessel, or putteth <em>it</em>
    under a bed; <br>
  </dd>
  <dd>but setteth <em>it</em> on a lamp-stand, that they which enter in may see the light.<br>
    17. </dd>
  <dd>For there is no secret <em>thing</em>, that shall not be made manifest ; nor hidden,
    that shall not be <br>
  </dd>
  <dd>known and come <br>
    18. </dd>
  <dd>into view. Take heed therefore how ye hear : for whosoever hath, to him shall be given :
    and whosoever<br>
  </dd>
  <dd>hath not, even what he seemed to have shall be taken from him.&quot;<br>
    19. </dd>
  <dd>And it was told him <em>by certain</em> which said, &quot;Thy mother and thy brethren
    stand without, desiring <br>
  </dd>
  <dd>to see thee&quot;<br>
    20. </dd>
  <dd>And he answered and said unto them , &quot; Who is my mother and who is <em>my</em>
    brethren? My mother <br>
  </dd>
  <dd>and my brethren are these, which hear the word of God, and do it!&quot;<br>
    21. </dd>
  <dd>Now it came to pass on one of the days, that he went into a boat and his disciples : and
    he said<br>
  </dd>
  <dd>unto them, &quot;Let us go over unto the other side of the lake&quot;. And they <br>
    22. </dd>
  <dd>launched forth. But as they sailed he fell asleep : and there came down a storm of wind
    on the lake<br>
  </dd>
  <dd>; and they were filling <em>with water</em>, and were in jeopardy, <br>
    23. </dd>
  <dd>And they came to him, and awoke him, saying, &quot;Master, master, we perish&quot; And
    he arose, and rebuked <br>
  </dd>
  <dd>the wind and the raging of the water : and they ceased, and there <br>
    24. </dd>
  <dd>was a calm. And he said unto them, &quot; Where is your faith?&quot; And they were
    frightened and wondered, saying<br>
  </dd>
  <dd>one to another, &quot;Who then is this? for he commandeth even the winds and water, and
    they obey him?&quot;<br>
    25. </dd>
  <dd>And they sailed down to the country of the Gandarenes, <br>
    26. </dd>
  <dd>which is over against Galilee. And when he went forth to land, there met him out of the
    city a certain man <br>
  </dd>
  <dd>, which had demons long time, and wore no cloke, neither abode <br>
    27. </dd>
  <dd>in a house, but among the tombs. When he saw Jesus, he cried out, and fell down before
    him, and with a <br>
  </dd>
  <dd>loud voice said, &quot;What have I to do with thee, Jesus, <em>thou</em> Son of <br>
    28. </dd>
  <dd>God most high? I beseech thee, torment me not.&quot; (For he had commanded the unclean
    spirit to come out <br>
  </dd>
  <dd>of the man. For oftentimes it had caught him : and he was guarded and bound with chains
    and in fetters: <br>
  </dd>
  <dd>and he brake the bands asunder, and was driven of the demon <br>
    29. </dd>
  <dd>into the deserts) And Jesus asked him , saying, &quot;What is <br>
    30. </dd>
  <dd>thy name?&quot; And he said, &quot;Legion&quot; because many demons were entered into
    him. And they besought him that he <br>
    31. </dd>
  <dd>would not command them to go out into the abyss. And there was an herd of many swine
    feeding of the mountain<br>
  </dd>
  <dd>: and they besought him that he would suffer them to enter into them. And he suffered
    them.<br>
    32. </dd>
  <dd>Then went the demons out of the man, and entered into the swine : and the herd ran
    violently down the <br>
    33. </dd>
  <dd>steep place into the lake, and were drowned. When they that fed <em>them</em> saw what
    was done, they fled <br>
  </dd>
  <dd>, and went and told <em>it</em><br>
    34. </dd>
  <dd>in the city and in the country. Then they went out to see what was done ; and came to
    Jesus, and found the man, <br>
  </dd>
  <dd>from whom the demons were departed, sitting at the feet of Jesus, clothed, and in his
    right mind : and they <br>
    35. </dd>
  <dd>were afraid. They also which saw <em>it</em> told them by what means he that was
    possessed of the demons <br>
  </dd>
  <dd>was saved.<br>
    36. </dd>
  <dd>Then the whole multitude of the country of the Gandarenes round about him asked him to
    depart from them; <br>
  </dd>
  <dd>for they were holden with great fear : and he entered into the <br>
    37. </dd>
  <dd>boat, and returned back again. Now the man, from whom the demons had departed, besought
    him that he <br>
  </dd>
  <dd>might be with him : but Jesus sent him away, saying <br>
    38. </dd>
  <dd>&quot;Return to thine house, and recount how great things God hath done unto thee.&quot;
    And he went his way, <br>
  </dd>
  <dd>publishing throughout the whole city how great things Jesus had done unto him.<br>
    39. </dd>
  <dd>And it came to pass, that, when Jesus returned, the multitude welcomed him : for they
    were all waiting for <br>
    40. </dd>
  <dd>him. And, behold, there came a man whose name was Jairus, and he was a ruler of the
    synagogue : and <br>
  </dd>
  <dd>he fell down at Jesus` feet , and besought him that he would<br>
    41. </dd>
  <dd>come into his house : For he had an only daughter, about twelve years of age, and she
    was dying. But <br>
  </dd>
  <dd>as he went the multitudes thronged him.<br>
    42. </dd>
  <dd>And a woman having an issue of blood twelve years, which had spent all her living upon
    physicians, neither <br>
    43. </dd>
  <dd>could be healed if any, came behind <em>him</em>, and touched the border of his garment
    ; and immediately<br>
  </dd>
  <dd>her issue of <br>
    44. </dd>
  <dd>blood stanched. And Jesus said, &quot;Who touched me?&quot; When all denied, Peter and
    they that were with him said<br>
  </dd>
  <dd>, &quot;Master , the multitude throng thee, and press <em>thee</em>, and <br>
    45. </dd>
  <dd>sayest thou, &quot;Who touched me?&quot; And Jesus said, &quot;Somebody touched me : for
    I perceived that power had gone<br>
    46. </dd>
  <dd>out of me.&quot; And when the woman saw that shw was not hid, she came trembling , and
    falling down before him, she <br>
  </dd>
  <dd>declared unto him before all the people for what reason she touched him, and how she was
    healed immediately.<br>
    47. </dd>
  <dd>And he said unto her, &quot;Daughter , be of good comfort : thy faith hath saved thee ;
    go into peace&quot;<br>
    48. </dd>
  <dd>While he yet spake , theere cometh one from the ruler of the synagogue`s <em>house</em>,
    saying to him, <br>
  </dd>
  <dd>&quot;The daughter is <br>
    49. </dd>
  <dd>dead ; trouble not the Teacher.&quot; But when Jesus heard <em>it</em>, he answered him,
    saying, &quot;Fear not, <br>
  </dd>
  <dd>believe only, <br>
    50. </dd>
  <dd>and she shall be saved.&quot; And when he came into the house, he suffered no man to go
    in, save Peter, <br>
  </dd>
  <dd>and James, and John, and the father and the mother of the maiden.<br>
    51. </dd>
  <dd>And all were weeping, and bewailing her, but he said : <br>
    52. </dd>
  <dd>&quot;Weep not : she is not dead, but sleepeth.&quot; And they <br>
    53. </dd>
  <dd>laughed to scorn him, knowing that she was dead. And he put them all out, and took her
    by the hand, and called<br>
    54. </dd>
  <dd>saying, &quot;Maid, arise&quot;. And her spirit came again, and she arose staightway ;
    and he commanded that <br>
  </dd>
  <dd><em>something</em> be <br>
    55. </dd>
  <dd>given her to eat. And her parents were astonished : but he charged them to tell no man
    what was done. </dd>
