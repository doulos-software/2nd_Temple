<hr>
<p>Pontius Pilate to Tiberius Caesar the emperor, greeting. (1)
<p>Upon Jesus Christ, whose case I had dearly set forth to thee in my last,
at length by the will of the people a bitter punishment has been inflicted,
myself being in a sort unwilling and rather afraid. A man, by Hercules,
so pious and strict, no age has ever had nor will have. But wonderful were
the efforts of the people themselves, and the unanimity of all the scribes
and chief men and elders, to crucify this ambassador of truth, notwithstanding
that their own prophets, and after our manner the sibyls, warned them against
it: and supernatural signs appeared while he was hanging, and, in the opinion
of philosophers, threatened destruction to the whole world. His disciples
are flourishing, in their work and the regulation of their lives not belying
their master; yea, in his name most beneficent. Had I not been afraid of
the rising of a sedition among the people, who were just on the point of
breaking out, perhaps this man would still have been alive to us; although,
urged more by fidelity to thy dignity than induced by my own wishes, I
did not according to my strength resist that innocent blood free from the
whole charge brought against it, but unjustly, through the malignity of
men, should be sold and suffer, yet, as the Scriptures signify, to their
own destruction. Farewell,
<p>28th March.&nbsp;
