<P>CHAP. 1.--The blessed and glorious ever-virgin Mary, sprung from the royal 
stock and family of David, born in the city of Nazareth, was brought up at 
Jerusalem in the temple of the Lord. Her father was named Joachim, and her 
mother Anna. Her father's house was from Galilee and the city of Nazareth, but 
her mother's family from Bethlehem. Their life was guileless and right before 
the Lord, and irreproachable and pious before men. For they divided all their 
substance into three parts. One part they spent upon the temple and the temple 
servants; another they distributed to strangers and the poor; the third they 
reserved, for themselves and the necessities of their family. Thus, dear to God, 
kind to men, for about twenty years they lived in their own house, a chaste 
married life, without having any children. Nevertheless they vowed that, should 
the Lord happen to give them offspring, they would deliver it to the service of 
the Lord; on which account also they used to visit the temple of the Lord at 
each of the feasts during the year. </P>
<P>CHAP. 2.--And it came to pass that the festival of the dedication[1] was at 
hand; wherefore also Joachim went up to Jerusalem with some men of his own 
tribe. Now at that time Issachar[2] was high priest there. And when he saw 
Joachim with his offering among his other fellow- citizens, he despised him, and 
spurned his gifts, asking why he, who had no offspring, presumed to stand among 
those who had; saying that his gifts could not by any means be acceptable to 
God, since He had deemed him unworthy of off-spring: for the Scripture said, 
Cursed is every one who has not begot a male or a female in Israel.[3] He said, 
therefore, that he ought first to be freed from this curse by the begetting of 
children; and then, and then only, that be should come into the presence of the 
Lord with his offerings. And Joachim, covered with shame from this reproach that 
was thrown in his teeth, retired to the shepherds, who were in their pastures 
with their flocks; nor would he return home, test perchance he might be branded 
with the same reproach by those of his own tribe, who were there at the time, 
and had heard this from the priest. </P>
<P>CHAP. 3.--Now, when he had been there for some time, on a certain day when he 
was alone, an angel of the Lord stood by him in a great light. And when he was 
disturbed at his appearance, the angel who had appeared to him restrained his 
fear, saying: Fear not, Joachim, nor be disturbed by my appearance; for I am the 
angel of the Lord, sent by Him to thee to tell thee that thy prayers have been 
heard, and that thy charitable deeds have gone up into His presence.[4] For He 
hath seen thy shame, and hath heard the reproach of unfruitfulness which has 
been unjustly brought against thee. For God is the avenger of sin, not of 
nature: and, therefore, when He shuts up the womb of any one, He does so that He 
may miraculously open it again; so that that which is born may be acknowledged 
to be not of lust, but of the gift of God. For was it not the case that the 
first mother of your nation--Sarah--was barren up to her eightieth year?[5] And, 
nevertheless, in extreme old age she brought forth Isaac, to whom the promise 
was renewed of the blessing of all nations. Rachel also, so favoured of the 
Lord, and so beloved by holy Jacob, was long barren; and yet she brought forth 
Joseph, who was not only the lord of Egypt, but the deliverer of many nations 
who were ready to perish of hunger. Who among the judges was either stronger 
than Samson, or more holy than Samuel? And yet the mothers of both were barren. 
If, therefore, the reasonableness of my words does not persuade thee, believe in 
fact that conceptions very late in life, and births in the case of women that 
have been barren, are usually attended with something wonderful. Accordingly thy 
wife Anna will bring forth a daughter to thee, and thou shall call her name 
Mary: she shall be, as you have vowed, consecrated to the Lord from her infancy, 
and she shall be filled with the Holy Spirit, even from her mother's womb. She 
shall neither eat nor drink any unclean thing, nor shall she spend her life 
among the crowds of the people without, but in the temple of the Lord, that it 
may not be possible either to say, or so much as to suspect, any evil concerning 
her. Therefore, when she has grown up, just as she herself shall be miraculously 
born of a barren woman, so in an incomparable manner she, a virgin, shall bring 
forth the Son of the Most High, who shall be called Jesus, and who, according to 
the etymology of His name, shall be the Saviour of all nations. And this shall 
be the sign to thee of those things which I announce: When thou shalt come to 
the Golden gate in Jerusalem, thou shalt there meet Anna thy wife, who, lately 
anxious from the delay of thy return, will then rejoice at the sight of thee. 
Having thus spoken, the angel departed from him. </P>
<P>CHAP. 4--Thereafter he appeared to Anna his wife, saying: Fear not, Anna, nor 
think that it is a phantom which thou seest. For I am that angel who has 
presented your prayers and alms before God; and now have I been sent to you to 
announce to you that thou shalt bring forth a daughter, who shall be called 
Mary, and who shall be blessed above all women. She, full of the favour of the 
Lord even from her birth, shall remain three years in her father's house until 
she be weaned. Thereafter, being delivered to the service of the Lord, she shall 
not depart from the temple until she reach the years of discretion. There, in 
fine, serving God day and night in fastings and prayers, she shall abstain from 
every unclean thing; she shall never know man, but alone, without example, 
immaculate, uncorrupted, without intercourse with man, she, a virgin, shall 
bring forth a son; she, His hand-maiden, shall bring forth the Lord--both in 
grace, and in name, and in work, the Saviour of the world. Wherefore arise, and 
go up to Jerusalem; and when thou shalt come to the gate which, because it is 
plated with gold, is called Golden, there, for a sign, thou shalt meet thy 
husband, for whose safety thou hast been anxious. And when these things shall 
have so happened, know that what I announce shall without doubt be fulfilled. 
</P>
<P>CHAP. 5.--Therefore, as the angel had commanded, both of them setting out 
from the place where they were, went up to Jerusalem; and when they had come to 
the place pointed out by the angel's prophecy, there they met each other. Then, 
rejoicing at seeing each other, and secure in the certainty of the promised 
offspring, they gave the thanks due to the Lord, who exalteth the humble. And 
so, having worshipped the Lord, they returned home, and awaited in certainty and 
in gladness the divine promise. Anna therefore conceived, and brought forth a 
daughter; and according to the command of the angel, her parents called her name 
Mary. </P>
<P>CHAP. 6.--And when the circle of three years had rolled round, and the time 
of her weaning was fulfilled, they brought the virgin to the temple of the Lord 
with offerings. Now there were round the temple, according to the fifteen Psalms 
of Degrees,[1] fifteen steps going up; for, on account of the temple having been 
built on a mountain, the altar of burnt-offering, which stood outside, could not 
be reached except by steps. On one of these, then, her parents placed the little 
girl, the blessed virgin Mary. And when they were putting off the clothes which 
they had worn on the journey, and were putting on, as was usual, others that 
were neater and cleaner, the virgin of the Lord went up all the steps, one after 
the other, without the help of any one leading her or lifting her, in such a 
manner that, in this respect at least, you would think that she had already 
attained full age. For already the Lord in the infancy of His virgin wrought a 
great thing, and by the indication of this miracle foreshowed how great she was 
to be. Therefore, a sacrifice having been offered according to the custom of the 
law, and their vow being perfected, they left the virgin within the enclosures 
of the temple, there to be educated with the other virgins, and themselves 
returned home. </P>
<P>CHAP. 7.--But the virgin of the Lord advanced in age and in virtues; and 
though, in the words of the Psalmist, her father and mother had forsaken her, 
the Lord took her up.[2] For daily was she visited by angels, daily did she 
enjoy a divine vision, which preserved her from all evil, and made her to abound 
in all good. And so she reached her fourteenth year; and not only were the 
wicked unable to charge her with anything worthy of reproach, but all the good, 
who knew her life and conversation, judged her to be worthy of admiration. Then 
the high priest publicly announced that the virgins who were publicly settled in 
the temple, and had reached this time of life, should return home and get 
married, according to the custom of the nation and the ripeness of their years. 
The others readily obeyed this command; but Mary alone, the virgin of the Lord, 
answered that she could not do this, saying both that her parents had devoted 
her to the service of the Lord, and that, moreover, she herself had made to the 
Lord a vow of virginity, which she would never violate by any intercourse with 
man. And the high priest, being placed in great perplexity of mind, seeing that 
neither did he think that the vow should be broken contrary to the Scripture, 
which says, Vow and pay,[1] nor did he dare to introduce a custom unknown to the 
nation, gave order that at the festival, which was at hand, all the chief 
persons from Jerusalem and the neighbourhood should be present, in order that 
from their advice he might know what was to be done in so doubtful a case. And 
when this took place, they resolved unanimously that the Lord should be 
consulted upon this matter. And when they all bowed themselves in prayer, the 
high priest went to consult God in the usual way. Nor had they long to wait: in 
the hearing of all a voice issued from the oracle and from the mercy-seat, that, 
according to the prophecy of Isaiah, a man should be sought out to whom the 
virgin ought to be entrusted and espoused. For it is clear that Isaiah says: A 
rod shall come forth from the root of Jesse, and a flower shall ascend from his 
root; and the Spirit of the Lord shall rest upon him, the spirit of wisdom and 
understanding, the spirit of counsel and strength, the spirit of wisdom and 
piety; and he shall be filled with the spirit of the fear of the Lord.[2] 
According to this prophecy, therefore, he predicted that all of the house and 
family of David that were unmarried and fit for marriage should bring there rods 
to the altar; and that he whose rod after it was brought should produce a 
flower, and upon the end of whose rod the Spirit of the Lord should settle in 
the form of a dove, was the man to whom the virgin ought to be entrusted and 
espoused. </P>
<P>CHAP. 8.--Now there was among the rest Joseph, of the house and family of 
David, a man of great age: and when all brought there rods, according to the 
order, he alone withheld his. Wherefore, when nothing in conformity with the 
divine voice appeared, the high priest thought it necessary to consult God a 
second time; and He answered, that of those who had been designated, he alone to 
whom the virgin ought to be espoused had not brought his rod. Joseph, therefore, 
was found out. For when he had brought his rod, and the dove came from heaven; 
and settled upon the top of it, it clearly appeared to all that he was the man 
to whom the virgin should be espoused. Therefore, the usual ceremonies of 
betrothal having been gone through, he went back to the city of Bethlehem to put 
his house in order, and to procure things necessary for the marriage. But Mary, 
the virgin of the Lord, with seven other virgins of her own age, and who had 
been weaned at the same time, whom she had received from the priest, returned to 
the house of her parents in Galilee. </P>
<P>CHAP. 9.--And in those days, that is, at the time of her first coming into 
Galilee, the angel Gabriel was sent to her by God, to announce to her the 
conception of the Lord, and to explain to her the manner and order of the 
conception. Accordingly, going in, he filled the chamber where she was with a 
great light; and most courteously saluting her, he said: Hail, Mary! O virgin 
highly favoured by the Lord, virgin full of grace, the Lord is with thee; 
blessed art thou above all women, blessed above all men that have been hitherto 
born.[3] And the virgin, who was already well acquainted with angelic faces, and 
was not unused to the light from heaven, was neither terrified by the vision of 
the angel, nor astonished at the greatness of the light, but only perplexed by 
his words; and she began to consider of what nature a salutation so unusual 
could be, or what it could portend, or what end it could have. And the angel, 
divinely inspired, taking up this thought, says: Fear not, Mary, as if anything 
contrary to thy chastity were hid under this salutation. For in choosing 
chastity, thou hast found favour with the Lord; and therefore thou, a virgin, 
shalt conceive without sin, and shalt bring forth a son. He shall be great, 
because He shall rule from sea to sea, and from the river even to the ends of 
the earth;[4] and He shall be called the Son of the Most High, because He who is 
born on earth in humiliation, reigns in heaven in exaltation; and the Lord God 
will give Him the throne of His father David, and He shall reign in the house of 
Jacob for ever, and of His kingdom there shall be no end;[5] forasmuch as He is 
King of kings and Lord of lords,[6] and His throne is from everlasting to 
everlasting. The virgin did not doubt these words of the angel; but wishing to 
know the manner of it, she answered: How can that come to pass? For while, 
according to my vow, I never know man, how can I bring forth without the 
addition of man's seed? To this the angel says: Think not, Mary, that thou shalt 
conceive in the manner of mankind: for without any intercourse with man, thou, a 
virgin, wilt conceive; thou, a virgin, wilt bring forth; thou, a virgin, wilt 
nurse: for the Holy Spirit shall come upon thee, and the power of the Most High 
shall overshadow thee,[7] without any of the heats of lust; and therefore that 
which shall be born of thee shall alone be holy, because it alone, being 
conceived and born without sin, shall be called the Son of God. Then Mary 
stretched forth her hands, and raised her eyes to heaven, and said: Behold the 
hand-maiden of the Lord, for I am not worthy of the name of lady; let it be to 
me according to thy word. </P>
<P>CHAP. 10.--Joseph therefore came from Judaea into Galilee, intending to marry 
the virgin who had been betrothed to him; for already three months had elapsed, 
and it was the beginning of the fourth since she had been betrothed to him. In 
the meantime, it was evident from her shape that she was pregnant, nor could she 
conceal this from Joseph. For in consequence of his being betrothed to her, 
coming to her more freely and speaking to her more familiarly, he found out that 
she was with child. He began then to be in great doubt and perplexity, because 
he did not know what was best for him to do. For, being a just man, he was not 
willing to expose her; nor, being a pious man, to injure her fair fame by a 
suspicion of fornication. He came to the conclusion, therefore, privately to 
dissolve their contract, and to send her away secretly. And while he thought on 
these things, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in his sleep, saying: 
Joseph, thou son of David, fear not; that is, do not have any suspicion of 
fornication in the virgin, or think any evil of her; and fear not to take her as 
thy wife: for that which is begotten in her, and which now vexes thy soul, is 
the work not of man, but of the Holy Spirit. For she alone of all virgins shall 
bring forth the Son of God, and thou shalt call His name Jesus, that is, 
Saviour; for He shall save His people from their sins. Therefore Joseph, 
according to the command of the angel, took the virgin as his wife; nevertheless 
he knew her not, but took care of her, and kept her in chastity.[1] And now the 
ninth month from her conception was at hand, when Joseph, taking with him his 
wife along with what things he needed, went to Bethlehem, the city from which he 
came. And it came to pass, while they were there, that her days were fulfilled 
that she should bring forth; and she brought forth her first-born son, as the 
holy evangelists have shown, our Lord Jesus Christ, who with the Father and the 
Son[2] and the Holy Ghost lives and reigns God from everlasting to everlasting.
