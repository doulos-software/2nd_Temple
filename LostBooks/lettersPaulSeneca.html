Introduction</h5>
The Correspondence of Paul and Seneca existed in the fourth century, for
Jerome mentions it, says it was 'read by many', and is led by it to insert
Seneca in his catalogue of Christian authors; Augustine also, quoting the
genuine Seneca, says, 'of whom some letters to the apostle Paul are current
read'. The Pseudo-Linus inserts a paragraph in his Passion of Paul telling
how Seneca frequently conversed and corresponded with Paul, admired him
much, and read some of his writings to Nero.
<p>Manuscripts as old as the ninth century exist, and of the twelfth--fifteenth
centuries there are many. The composition is of the poorest kind: only
its celebrity induces me to translate it once again.

<hr>
<p>1. SENECA TO PAUL, greeting
<p>I believe, Paul, that you have been informed of the talk which I had
yesterday with my Lucilius about the apocrypha (or possibly the secret
mysteries) and other things; for certain sharers in your teaching were
with me. For we had retired to the gardens of Sallust, where, because of
us, those whom I speak of, going in another direction, saw and joined us.
Certainly we wished for your presence, and I would have you know it. We
were much refreshed by the reading of your book, by which I mean some of
the many letters which you have addressed to some city or capital of a
province, and which inculcate the moral life with admirable precepts. These
thoughts, I take it, are not uttered by you but through you, but surely
sometimes both by you and through you: for such is the greatness of them
and they are instinct (warm) with such nobility, that I think whole generations
(ages) of men could hardly suffice for the instilling and perfecting of
them. I desire your good health, brother.
<p>2. PAUL TO SENECA, greeting
<p>I received your letter yesterday with delight, and should have been
able to answer it at once, had I had by me the youth I meant to send to
you. For you know when, and by whom, and at what moment, and to whom things
ought to be given and entrusted. I beg, therefore, that you will not think
yourself neglected, when I am respecting the dignity of your person. Now
in that you somewhere write that you are pleased with my letter (or, write
that you are pleased with part of my letter) I think myself happy in the
good opinion of such a man: for you would not say it, you, a critic, a
sophist, the teacher of a great prince, and indeed of all -unless you spoke
truth. I trust you may long be in health.
<p>3. SENECA TO PAUL, greeting
<p>I have arranged some writings in a volume, and given them their proper
divisions: I am also resolved to read them to Caesar, if only fortune be
kind, that he may bring a new (an interested) ear to the hearing. Perhaps
you, too, will be there. If not, I will at another time fix you a day,
that we may look over the work together: indeed, I could not produce this
writing to him, without first conferring with you, if only that could be
done without risk: that you may know that you are not being neglected.
Farewell, dearest Paul.
<p>4. PAUL TO ANNAEUS SENECA, greeting
<p>Whenever I hear your letters read, I think of you as present, and imagine
nothing else but that you are always with us. As soon, then, as you begin
to come, we shall see each other at close quarters. I desire your good
health.
<p>5. SENECA TO PAUL, greeting
<p>We are much pained by your retirement. What is it? what causes keep
you away? if it be the anger of the lady (Poppaea) because you have left
the old rite and sect, and have converted others, there will be a possibility
of pleading with her, that she may consider it as done on due reflection
and not lightly.
<p>6. PAUL TO SENECA AND LUCILIUS, greeting
<p>Of the subject on which you have written I must not speak with pen and
ink, of which the former marks out and draws somewhat, and the latter shows
it clearly, especially as I know that among you -that is, in your homes
and in you- there are those who understand me. Honour is to be paid to
all, and so much the more because men catch at opportunities of being offended.
If we are patient with them, we shall certainly over-come them at every
point, provided they be men who can be sorry for their actions. Farewell.
<p>7. ANNAEUS SENECA TO PAUL AND THEOPHILUS, greeting
<p>I profess myself well content with the reading of your letters which
you sent to the Galatians, Corinthians, and Achaeans; and may we so live
together as you show yourself to be inspired with the divine frenzy (horror).
For it is the holy spirit which is in you and high above you which expresses
these exalted and adorable thoughts. I would therefore have you careful
of other points, that the polish of the style may not be wanting to the
majesty of the thought. And, brother, not to conceal anything from you,
and have it on my conscience, I confess to you that the Augustus was moved
by your views. When I read to him the beginning of the power (virtue) that
is in you (perhaps he meant your exordium about virtue) his words were
these: that he could wonder that a man not regularly educated could think
thus. I replied that the gods often speak by the mouths of the simple (innocent),
not of those who try deceitfully to show what they can do by their learning.
And when I cited him the example of Vatienus the rustic, to whom two men
appeared in the territory of Reate, who afterwards were recognized as Castor
and Pollux, he appeared fully convinced. Farewell.
<p>8. PAUL TO SENECA, greeting
<p>Though I am aware that Caesar, even if he sometimes lapses, is a lover
of our wonders, you will suffer yourself to be, not wounded but admonished.
For I think that you took a very serious step in bringing to his notice
a matter alien to his religion and training. For since he is a worshipper
of the gods of the nations, I do not see why you thought you would wish
him to know this matter, unless I am to think that you did it out of excessive
attachment to me. I beg you not to do so in future; For you must be careful
not to offend the empress in your love for me: yet her anger will not hurt
us if it lasts, nor do good if it does not [this is nonsense]. As a queen,
she will not be angry: as a woman, she will be offended. Farewell.
<p>9. SENECA TO PAUL, greeting
<p>I know that you are not so much disturbed on your own account by my
letter to you on the showing of your letters to Caesar, as by the nature
of things, which so calls away the minds of men from all right learning
and conduct -so that I am not surprised, for I have learnt this for certain
by many examples. Let us then act differently, and if in the past anything
has been done carelessly, you will pardon it. I have sent you a book on
elegance of expression (store of words). Farewell, dearest Paul.
<p>10. TO SENECA, PAUL, greeting
<p>Whenever I write to you and do not place my name after yours (see the
heading) I do a serious thing and one unbefitting my persuasion (sect).
For I ought, as I have often declared, to be all things to all men, and
to observe in your person that which the Roman law has granted to the honour
of the senate, and choose the last place in writing (text, reading) a letter,
not striving to do as I please in a confused and disgraceful way. Farewell,
most devoted of masters. Given on the 5th of the kalends of July; Nero
the fourth time, and Messala, consuls (A. D. 58).
<p>11. SENECA TO PAUL, greeting
<p>Hail, my dearest Paul. If you, so great a man, so beloved in all ways,
be -I say not joined- but intimately associated with me and my name, it
will indeed be well with your Seneca. Since then, you are the summit and
topmost peak of all people, would you not have me glad that I am so near
you as to be counted a second self of yours ? Do not, then, think that
you are unworthy to be named first on the heading of letters, lest you
make me think you are testing me rather than playing with me -especially
as you know yourself to be a Roman citizen. For the rank that is mine,
I would it were yours, and yours I would were mine. Farewell, dearest Paul.
Given on the 10th of the kalends of April; Apronianus and Capito consuls
(59).
<p>12. SENECA TO PAUL, greeting
<p>Hail, my dearest Paul. Think you that I am not in sadness and grief,
that your innocent people are so often condemned to suffer? And next, that
the whole people thinks you so callous and so prone to crime, that you
are supposed to be the authors of every misfortune in the city? Yet let
us bear it patiently and content ourselves with what fortune brings, until
supreme happiness puts an end to our troubles. Former ages had to bear
the Macedonian, Philip's son, and, after Darius, Dionysius, and our own
times endured Gaius Caesar: to all of whom their will was law. The source
of the many fires which Rome suffers plain. But if humble men could speak
out what the reason is, and if it were possible to speak without risk in
this dark time, all would be plain to all. Christians and Jews are commonly
executed as contrivers of the fire. Whoever the criminal is whose pleasure
is that of a butcher, and who veils himself with a lie, he is reserved
for his due season: and as the best of men is sacrificed, the one for the
many, so he, vowed to death for all, will be burned with fire. A hundred
and thirty-two houses and four blocks have been burnt in six days, the
seventh brought a pause. I pray you may be well, brother. Given the 5th
of the kalends of April; Frugi and Bassus consuls (64).
<p>13. SENECA TO PAUL, greeting
<p>Much in every part of your works is enclosed in allegory and enigma,
and therefore the great force that is given you of matter and talent (?)
should be beautified, I do not say with elegance of words, but with a certain
care. Nor should you fear what I remember you have often said; that many
who affect such things vitiate the thought and emasculate the strength
of the matter. But I wish you would yield to me and humour the genius of
Latin, and give beauty to your noble words, that the great gift that has
been granted you may be worthily treated by you. Farewell.
<p>Given on the day before the nones of June; Leo and Sabinus consuls (non-existent).
<p>14. PAUL TO SENECA, greeting
<p>To your meditations have been revealed those things which the Godhead
has granted to few. With confidence, therefore, I sow in a field already
fertile a most prolific seed, not such matter as is liable to corruption,
but the abiding word, an emanation from God who grows and abides for ever.
This your wisdom has attained and you will see that it is unfailing -so
as to judge that the laws of heathens and Israelites are to be shunned.
You may become a new author, by showing forth with the graces of rhetoric
the unblameable wisdom of Jesus Christ, which you, having well nigh attained
it, will instil into the temporal monarch, his servants, and his intimate
friends, yet the persuading of them will be a rough and difficult task,
for many of them will hardly incline to your admonitions. Yet the word
of God, if it be instilled into them, will be a vital gain, producing a
new man, incorrupt, and an everlasting soul that shall hasten from hence
to God. Farewell, Seneca, most dear to me.
<p>Given on the kalends of August; Leo and Sabinus consuls.
