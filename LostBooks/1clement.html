<H2 align=center>Chapter 1 </H2>
<H3 align=center>The Salutation &amp;<BR>Praise Of The Corinthians Before The 
Breaking Forth Of Schism Among them </H3>
<P>The Church of God which sojourns at Rome, to the Church of God sojourning at 
Corinth, to them that are called and sanctified by the will of God, through our 
Lord Jesus Christ: Grace unto you, and peace, from Almighty God through Jesus 
Christ, be multiplied. 
<P>Owing, dear brethren, to the sudden and successive calamitous events which 
have happened to ourselves, we feel that we have been somewhat tardy in turning 
our attention to the points respecting which you consulted us; and especially to 
that shameful and detestable sedition, utterly abhorrent to the elect of God, 
which a few rash and self-confident persons have kindled to such a pitch of 
frenzy, that your venerable and illustrious name, worthy to be universally 
loved, has suffered grievous injury. For who ever dwelt even for a short time 
among you, and did not find your faith to be as fruitful of virtue as it was 
firmly established? Who did not admire the sobriety and moderation of your 
godliness in Christ? Who did not proclaim the magnificence of your habitual 
hospitality? And who did not rejoice over your perfect and well-grounded 
knowledge? For ye did all things without respect of persons, and walked in the 
command-merits of God, being obedient to those who had the rule over you, and 
giving all fitting honour to the presbyters among you. Ye enjoined young men to 
be of a sober and serious mind; ye instructed your wives to do all things with a 
blameless, becoming, and pure conscience, loving their husbands as in duty 
bound; and ye taught them that, living in the rule of obedience, they should 
manage their household affairs becomingly, and be in every respect marked by 
discretion. 
<H2 align=center>Chapter 2 </H2>
<H3 align=center>Praise Of The Corinthians Continued </H3>
<P align=left>Moreover, ye were all distinguished by humility, and were in no 
respect puffed up with pride, but yielded obedience rather than extorted it, and 
were more willing to give than to receive? Content with the provision which God 
had made for you, and carefully attending to His words, ye were inwardly filled 
with His doctrine, and His sufferings were before your eyes. Thus a profound and 
abundant peace was given to you all, and ye had an insatiable desire for doing 
good, while a full outpouring of the Holy Spirit was upon you all. Full of holy 
designs, ye did, with true earnestness of mind and a godly confidence, stretch 
forth your hands to God Almighty, beseeching Him to be merciful unto you, if ye 
had been guilty of any involuntary transgression. Day and night ye were anxious 
for the whole brotherhood, that the number of God's elect might be saved with 
mercy and a good conscience. Ye were sincere and uncorrupted, and forgetful of 
injuries between one another. Every kind of faction and schism was abominable in 
your sight. Ye mourned over the transgressions of your neighhours: their 
deficiencies you deemed your own. Ye never grudged any act of kindness, being 
"ready to every good work." Adorned by a thoroughly virtuous and religious life, 
ye did all things in the fear of God. The commandments and ordinances of the 
Lord were written upon the tablets of your hearts. 
<H2 align=center>Chapter 3 </H2>
<H3 align=center>The Sad State Of The Corinthian Church After Sedition Arose In 
It<BR>From Envy And Emulation </H3>
<P>Every kind of honour and happiness was bestowed upon you, and then was 
fulfilled that which is written, "My beloved did eat and drink, and was enlarged 
and became fat, and kicked." Hence flowed emulation and envy, strife and 
sedition, persecution and disorder, war and captivity. So the worthless rose up 
against the honoured, those of no reputation against such as were renowned, the 
foolish against the wise, the young against those advanced in years. For this 
reason righteousness and peace are now far departed from you, inasmuch as every 
one abandons the fear of God, and is become blind in His faith, neither walks in 
the ordinances of His appointment, nor acts a part becoming a Christian but 
walks after his own wicked lusts, resuming the practice of an unrighteous and 
ungodly envy, by which death itself entered into the world. 
<H2 align=center>Chapter 4 </H2>
<H3 align=center>Many Evils Have Already Flowed From This Source In Ancient 
Times </H3>
<P>For thus it is written: "And it came to pass after certain days, that Cain 
brought of the fruits of the earth a sacrifice unto God; and Abel also brought 
of the firstlings of his sheep, and of the fat thereof. And God had respect to 
Abel and to his offerings, but Cain and his sacrifices He did not regard. And 
Cain was deeply grieved, and his countenance fell. And God said to Cain, Why art 
thou grieved, and why is try countenance fallen? If thou offerest rightly, but 
dost not divide rightly, hast thou not sinned? Be at peace: thine offering 
returns to thyself, and thou shalt again possess it. And Cain said to Abel his 
brother, Let us go into the field. And it came to pass, while they were in the 
field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother, and slew him." Ye see, 
brethren, how envy and jealousy led to the murder of a brother. Through envy, 
also, our father Jacob fled from the face of Esau his brother. Envy made Joseph 
be persecuted unto death, and to come into bondage. Envy compelled Moses to flee 
from the face of Pharaoh king of Egypt, when he heard these words from his 
fellow-countryman, "Who made thee a judge or a ruler over us? wilt thou kill me, 
as thou didst kill the Egyptian yesterday?" On account of envy, Aaron and Miriam 
had to make their abode without the camp. Envy brought down Dathan and Abiram 
alive to Hades, through the sedition which they excited against God's servant 
Moses. Through envy, David underwent the hatred not only of foreigners, but was 
also persecuted by Saul king of Israel. 
<H2 align=center>Chapter 5 </H2>
<H3 align=center>No Less Evils Have Arisen From The Same Source In The Most 
Recent Times,<BR>The Martyrdom Of Peter And Paul </H3>
<P>But not to dwell upon ancient examples, let us come to the most recent 
spiritual heroes. Let us take the noble examples furnished in our own 
generation. Through envy and jealousy, the greatest and most righteous 
pillars[of the Church] have been persecuted and put to death. Let us set before 
our eyes the illustrious apostles. Peter, through unrighteous envy, endured not 
one or two, but numerous labours and when he had at length suffered martyrdom, 
departed to the place of glory due to him. Owing to envy, Paul also obtained the 
reward of patient endurance, after being seven times thrown into captivity, 
compelled to flee, and stoned. After preaching both in the east and west, he 
gained the illustrious reputation due to his faith, having taught righteousness 
to the whole world, and come to the extreme limit of the west, and suffered 
martyrdom under the prefects. Thus was he removed from the world, and went into 
the holy place, having proved himself a striking example of patience. 
<H2 align=center>Chapter 6 </H2>
<H3 align=center>Continuation: Several Other Martyrs </H3>
<P>To these men who spent their lives in the practice of holiness, there is to 
be added a great multitude of the elect, who, having through envy endured many 
indignities and tortures, furnished. us with a most excellent example. Through 
envy, those women, the Danaids and Dircae, being persecuted, after they had 
suffered terrible and unspeakable torments, finished the course of their faith 
with stedfastness, and though weak in body, received a noble reward. Envy has 
alienated wives from their husbands, and changed that saying of our father Adam, 
"This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh." Envy and strife have 
overthrown great cities and rooted up mighty nations. 
<H2 align=center>Chapter 7 </H2>
<H3 align=center>An Exhortation To Repentance </H3>
<P>These things, beloved, we write unto you, not merely to admonish you of your 
duty, but also to remind ourselves. For we are struggling on the same arena, and 
the same conflict is assigned to both of us. Wherefore let us give up vain and 
fruitless cares, and approach to the glorious and venerable rule of our holy 
calling. Let us attend to what is good, pleasing, and acceptable in the sight of 
Him who formed us. Let us look stedfastly to the blood of Christ, and see how 
precious that blood is to God, which, having been shed for our salvation, has 
set the grace of repentance before the whole world. Let us turn to every age 
that has passed, and learn that, from generation to generation, the Lord has 
granted a place of repentance to all such as would be converted unto Him. Noah 
preached repentance, and as many as listened to him were saved. Jonah proclaimed 
destruction to the Ninevites; but they, repenting of their sins, propitiated God 
by prayer, and obtained salvation, although they were aliens [to the covenant] 
of God. 
<H2 align=center>Chapter 8 </H2>
<H3 align=center>Continuation Respecting Repentance </H3>
<P>The ministers of the grace of God have, by the Holy Spirit, spoken of 
repentance; and the Lord of all things has himself declared with an oath 
regarding it, "As I live, saith the Lord, I desire not the death of the sinner, 
but rather his repentance ; " adding, moreover, this gracious declaration Repent 
O house of Israel, of your iniquity. Say to the children of My people, Though 
your sins reach from earth to heaven, I and though they be redder than scarlet, 
and blacker than sackcloth, yet if ye turn to Me with your whole heart, and say, 
Father ! I will listen to you, as to a holy people." And in another place He 
speaks thus: "Wash you, and become clean; put away the wickedness of your souls 
from before mine eyes; cease from your evil ways, and learn to do well; seek out 
judgment, deliver the oppressed, judge the fatherless, and see that justice is 
done to the widow; and come, and let us reason together. He declares, Though 
your sins be like crimson, I will make them white as snow; though they be like 
scarlet, I will whiten them like wool. And if ye be willing and obey Me, ye 
shall eat the good of the land; but if ye refuse, and will not hearken unto Me, 
the sword shall devour you, for the mouth of the Lord hath spoken these things." 
Desiring, therefore, that all His beloved should be partakers of repentance, He 
has, by His almighty will, established [these declarations]. 
<H2 align=center>Chapter 9 </H2>
<H3 align=center>Examples Of The Saints </H3>
<P>Wherefore, let us yield obedience to His excellent and glorious will; and 
imploring His mercy and loving-kindness, while we forsake all fruitless labours, 
and strife, and envy, which leads to death, let us turn and have recourse to His 
compassions. Let us stedfastly contemplate those who have perfectly ministered 
to His excellent glory. Let us take (for instance) Enoch, who, being found 
righteous in obedience, was translated, and death was never known to happen to 
him? Noah, being found faithful, preached regeneration to the world through his 
ministry; and the Lord saved by him the animals which, with one accord, entered 
into the ark. 
<H2 align=center>Chapter 10 </H2>
<H3 align=center>Continuation Of The Above </H3>
<P>Abraham, styled "the friend," was found faithful, inasmuch as he rendered 
obedience to the words of God. He, in the exercise of obedience, went out from 
his own country, and from his kindred, and from his father's house, in order 
that, by forsaking a small territory, and a weak family, and an insignificant 
house, he might inherit the promises of God. For God said to him, "Get thee out 
from thy country,, and from thy kindred, and from thy father's house, into the 
land which I shall show thee. And I will make thee a great nation, and will 
bless thee, and make thy name great, and thou shall be blessed. And I will bless 
them that bless thee, and curse them that curse thee; and in thee shall all the 
families of the earth be blessed." And again, on his departing from Lot, God 
said to him. "Lift up thine eyes, and look from the place where thou now art, 
northward, and southward, and eastward, and westward; for all the land which 
thou seest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed for ever. And I will make 
thy seed as the dust of the earth, [so that] if a man can number the dust of the 
earth, then shall thy seed also be numbered." And again [the Scripture] saith, 
"God brought forth Abram, and spake unto him, Look up now to heaven, and count 
the stars if thou be able to number them; so shall thy seed be. And Abram 
believed God, and it was counted to him for righteousness." On account of his 
faith and hospitality, a son was given him in his old age; and in the exercise 
of obedience, he offered him as a sacrifice to God on one of the mountains which 
He showed him. 
<P>Chapter 11 
<H3 align=center>Continuation: Lot </H3>
<P>On account of his hospitality and godliness, Lot was saved out of Sodore when 
all the country round was punished by means of fire and brimstone, the Lord thus 
making it manifest that He does not forsake those that hope in Him, but gives up 
such as depart from Him to punishment and torture. For Lot's wife, who went 
forth with him, being of a different mind from himself and not continuing in 
agreement with him [as to the command which had been given them], was made an 
example of, so as to be a pillar of salt unto this day. This was done that all 
might know that those who are of a double mind, and who distrust the power of 
God, bring down judgment on themselves? and become a sign to all succeeding 
generations. 
<H2 align=center>Chapter 12 </H2>
<H3 align=center>The Rewards Of Faith And Hospitality: Rahab </H3>
<P>On account of her faith and hospitality, Rahab the harlot was saved. For when 
spies were sent by Joshua, the son of Nun, to Jericho, the king of the country 
ascertained that they were come to spy out their land, and sent men to seize 
them, in order that, when taken, they might be put to death. But the hospitable 
Rahab receiving them, concealed them on the roof of her house under some stalks 
of flax. And when the men sent by the king arrived and said "There came men unto 
thee who are to spy out our land; bring them forth, for so the king commands," 
she answered them, "The two men whom ye seek came unto me, but quickly departed 
again and are gone," thus not discovering the spies to them. Then she said to 
the men, "I know assuredly that the Lord your God hath given you this city, for 
the fear and dread of you have fallen on its inhabitants. When therefore ye 
shall have taken it, keep ye me and the house of my father in safety." And they 
said to her, "It shall be as thou hast spoken to us. As soon, therefore, as thou 
knowest that we are at hand, thou shall gather all thy family under thy roof, 
and they shall be preserved, but all that. are found outside of thy dwelling 
shall perish." Moreover, they gave her a sign to this effect, that she should 
hang forth from her house a scarlet thread. And thus they made it manifest that 
redemption should flow through the blood of the Lord to all them that believe 
and hope in God. Ye see, beloved, that there was not only faith, but prophecy, 
in this woman. 
<H2 align=center>Chapter 13 </H2>
<H3 align=center>An Exhortation To Humility </H3>
<P>Let us therefore, brethren, be of humble mind, laying aside all haughtiness, 
and pride, and foolishness, and angry feelings; and let us act according to that 
which is written (for the Holy Spirit saith, "Let not the wise man glory in his 
wisdom, neither let the mighty man glory in his might, neither let the rich man 
Story in his riches; but let him that glorieth glory in the Lord, in diligently 
seeking Him, and doing judgment and righteousness"), being especially mindful of 
the words of the Lord Jesus which He spake, teaching us meekness and 
long-suffering. For thus He spoke: "Be ye merciful, that ye may obtain mercy; 
forgive, that it may be forgiven to you ; as ye do, so shall it be done unto 
you; as ye judge, so shall ye be judged; as ye are kind, so shall kindness be 
shown to you; with what measure ye mete, with the same it shall be measured to 
you." By this precept and by these rules let us stablish ourselves, that we walk 
with all humility in obedience to His holy words. For the holy word saith, "On 
whom shall I look, but on him that is meek and peaceable, and that trembleth at 
My words?" 
<H2 align=center>Chapter 14 </H2>
<H3 align=center>We Should Obey God Rather Than The Authors Of Sedition </H3>
<P>It is right and holy therefore, men and brethren, rather to obey God than to 
follow those who, through pride and sedition, have become the leaders of a 
detestable emulation. For we shall incur no slight injury, but rather great 
danger, if we rashly yield ourselves to the inclinations of men who aim at 
exciting strife and tumults, so as to draw us away from what is good. Let us be 
kind one to another after the pattern of the tender mercy and benignity of our 
Creator. For it is written, "The kind-hearted shall inhabit the land, and the 
guiltless shall be left upon it, but transgressors shall be destroyed from off 
the face of it." And again [the Scripture] saith, "I saw the ungodly highly 
exalted, and lifted up like the cedars of Lebanon: I passed by, and, behold, he 
was not; and I diligently sought his place, and could not find it. Preserve 
innocence, and look on equity: for there shall be a remnant to the peaceful 
man." 
<H2 align=center>Chapter 15 </H2>
<H3 align=center>We Must Adhere To Those Who Cultivate Peace, Not To Those 
<BR>Who Merely Pretend To Do So </H3>
<P>Let us cleave, therefore, to those who cultivate peace with godliness, and 
not to those who hypocritically profess to desire it. For [the Scripture] saith 
in a certain place, "This people honoureth Me with their lips, but their heart 
is far from Me." And again: "They bless with their mouth, but curse with their 
heart." And again it saith, "They loved Him with their mouth, and lied to Him 
with their tongue; but their heart was not right with Him, neither were they 
faithful in His covenant." "Let the deceitful lips become silent," [and "let the 
Lord destroy all the lying lips,] and the boastful tongue of those who have 
said, Let us magnify our tongue; our lips are our own; who is lord over us? For 
the oppression of the poor, and for the sighing of the needy, will I now arise, 
saith the Lord: I will place him in safety; I will deal confidently with him." 
<H2 align=center>Chapter 16 </H2>
<H3 align=center>Christ As An Example Of Humility </H3>
<P>For Christ is of those who are humble-minded, and not of those who exalt 
themselves over His flock. Our Lord Jesus Christ, the Sceptre of the majesty of 
God, did not come in the pomp of pride or arrogance, although He might have done 
so, but in a lowly condition, as the Holy Spirit had declared regarding Him. For 
He says, "Lord, who hath believed our report, and to whom is the arm of the Lord 
revealed ? We have declared [our message] in His presence: He is, as it were, a 
child, and like a root in thirsty ground; He has no form nor glory, yea, we saw 
Him, and He had no form nor comeliness; but His form was without eminence, yea, 
deficient in comparison with the [ordinary] form of men. He is a man exposed to 
stripes and suffering, anti acquainted with the endurance of grief: for His 
countenance was turned away; He was despised, and not esteemed. He bears our 
iniquities, and is in sorrow for our sakes; yet we supposed that [on His own 
account] He was exposed to labour, and stripes, and affliction. But He was 
wounded for our transgressions, and bruised for our iniquities. The chastisement 
of our peace was upon Him, and by His stripes we were healed. All we, like 
sheep, have gone astray; [every] man has wandered in his own way; and the Lord 
has delivered Him up for our sins, while He in the midst of His sufferings 
openeth not His mouth. He was brought as a sheep to the slaughter, and as a lamb 
before her shearer is dumb, so He openeth not His mouth. In His humiliation His 
judgment was taken away; who shall declare His generation? for His life is taken 
from the earth. For the transgressions of my people was He brought down to 
death. And I will give the wicked for His sepulchre, and the rich for His death? 
because He did no iniquity, neither was guile found in His mouth. And the Lord 
is pleased to purify Him by stripes. If ye make an offering for sin, your soul 
shall see a long-lived seed. And the Lord is pleased to relieve Him of the 
affliction of His soul, to show Him light, and to form Him with understanding, 
to justify the Just One who ministereth well to many; and the Himself shall 
carry their sins. On this account He shall inherit many, and shall divide the 
spoil of the strong; because His soul was delivered to death, and He was 
reckoned among the transgressors, and He bare the sins of many, and for their 
sins was He delivered." And again He saith, "I am a worm, and no man; a reproach 
of men, and despised of the people. All that see Me have derided Me; they have 
spoken with their lips; they have wagged their head, [saying] He hoped in God, 
let Him deliver Him, let Him save Him, since He delighteth in Him." Ye see, 
beloved, what is the example which has been given us; for if the Lord thus 
humbled Himself, what shall we do who have through Him come under the yoke of 
His grace ? 
<H2 align=center>Chapter 17 </H2>
<H3 align=center>The Saints As Examples Of Humility </H3>
<P>Let us be imitators also of those who in goat-skins and sheep-skins went 
about proclaiming the coming of Christ; I mean Elijah, Elisha, and Ezekiel among 
the prophets, with those others to whom a like testimony is borne [in 
Scripture]. Abraham was specially honoured, and was called the friend of God; 
yet he, earnestly regarding the glory of God, humbly declared, "I am but dust 
and ashes." Moreover, it is thus written of Job, "Job was a righteous man, and 
blameless, truthful, God-fearing, and one that kept himself from all evil." But 
bringing an accusation against himself, he said, " No man is free from 
defilement, even if his life be but of one day."Moses was called faithful in all 
God's house; and through his instrumentality, God punished Egypt with plagues 
and tortures. Yet he, though thus greatly honoured, did not adopt lofty 
language, but said, when the divine oracle came to him out of the bush, "Who am 
I, that Thou sendest me ? I am a man of a feeble voice and a slow tongue." And 
again he said, "I am but as the smoke of a pot." 
<H2 align=center>Chapter 18 </H2>
<H3 align=center>David As An Example Of Humility </H3>
<P>But what shall we say concerning David, to whom such testimony was borne, and 
of whom God said, "I have found a man after Mine own heart, David the son of 
Jesse; and in everlasting mercy have I anointed him?" Yet this very man saith to 
God, "Have mercy on me, O Lord, according to Thy great mercy; and according to 
the multitude of Thy compassions, blot out my transgression. Wash me still more 
from mine iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin. For I acknowledge my iniquity, 
and my sin is ever before me. Against Thee only have I sinned, and done that 
which was evil in Thy sight; that Thou mayest be justified in Thy sayings, and 
mayest overcome when Thou art judged. For, behold, I was conceived in 
transgressions, and in my sins did my mother conceive me. For, behold, Thou hast 
loved truth; the secret and hidden things of wisdom hast Thou shown me. Thou 
shalt sprinkle me with hyssop, and I shall be cleansed; Thou shalt wash me, and 
I shall be whiter than snow. Thou shalt make me to hear joy and gladness; my 
bones, which have been humbled, shall exult. Turn away Thy face from my sins, 
and blot out all mine iniquities. Create in me a clean heart, O God, and renew a 
right spirit within me. Cast me not away from Thy presence, and take not Thy 
Holy Spirit from me. Restore to me the joy of Thy salvation, and establish me by 
Thy governing Spirit. I will teach transgressors Thy ways, and the ungodly shall 
be converted unto Thee. Deliver me from blood-guiltiness, O God, the God of my 
salvation: my tongue shall exult in Thy righteousness. O Lord, Thou shalt open 
my mouth, and my lips shall show forth Thy praise. For if Thou hadst desired 
sacrifice, I would have given it; Thou wilt not delight in burnt-offerings. The 
sacrifice [acceptable] to God is a bruised spirit; a broken and a contrite heart 
God will not despise." 
<H2 align=center>Chapter 19 </H2>
<H3 align=center>Imitating These Examples, Let Us Seek After Peace </H3>
<P>Thus the humility and godly submission of so great and illustrious men have 
rendered not only us, but also all the generations before us, better; even as 
many as have received His oracles in fear and truth. Wherefore, having so many 
great and glorious examples set before us, let us turn again to the practice of 
that peace which from the beginning was the mark set before us; and let us look 
stedfastly to the Father and Creator of the universe, and cleave to His mighty 
and surpassingly great gifts and benefactions, of peace. Let us contemplate Him 
with our understanding, and look with the eyes of our soul to His long-suffering 
will. Let us reflect how free from wrath He is towards all His creation. 
<H2 align=center>Chapter 20 </H2>
<H3 align=center>The Peace And Harmony Of The Universe </H3>
<P>The heavens, revolving under His government, are subject to Him in peace. Day 
and night run the course appointed by Him, in no wise hindering each other. The 
sun and moon, with the companies of the stars, roll on in harmony according to 
His command, within their prescribed limits, and without any deviation. The 
fruitful earth, according to His will, brings forth food in abundance, at the 
proper seasons, for man and beast and all the living beings upon it, never 
hesitating, nor changing any of the ordinances which He has fixed. The 
unsearchable places of abysses, and the indescribable arrangements of the lower 
world, are restrained by the same laws. The vast unmeasurable sea, gathered 
together by His working into various basins, never passes beyond the bounds 
placed around it, but does as He has commanded. For He said, "Thus far shalt 
thou come, and thy waves shall be broken within thee." The ocean, impassible to 
man, and the worlds beyond it, are regulated by the same enactments of the Lord. 
The seasons of spring, summer, autumn, and winter, peacefully give place to one 
another. The winds in their several quarters fulfil, at the proper time, their 
service without hindrance. The ever-flowing fountains, formed both for enjoyment 
and health, furnish without fail their breasts for the life of men. The very 
smallest of living beings meet together in peace and concord. All these the 
great Creator and Lord of all has appointed to exist in peace and harmony; while 
He does good to all, but most abundantly to us who have fled for refuge to His 
compassions through Jesus Christ our Lord, to whom be glory and majesty for ever 
and ever. Amen. 
<H2 align=center>Chapter 21 </H2>
<H3 align=center>Let Us Obey God, And Not The Authors Of Sedition </H3>
<P>Take heed, beloved, lest His many kindnesses lead to the condemnation of us 
all. [For thus it must be] unless we walk worthy of Him, and with one mind do 
those things which are good and well-pleasing in His sight. For [the Scripture] 
saith in a certain place, "The Spirit of the Lord is a candle searching the 
secret parts of the belly." Let us reflect how near He is, and that none of the 
thoughts or reasonings in which we engage are hid from Him. It is right, 
therefore, that we should not leave the post which His will has assigned us. Let 
us rather offend those men who are foolish, and inconsiderate, and lifted up, 
and who glory in the pride of their speech, than [offend] God. Let us reverence 
the Lord Jesus Christ, whose blood was given for us; let us esteem those who 
have the rule over us; let us honour the aged among us; let us train up the 
young men in the fear of God; let us direct our wives to that which is good. Let 
them exhibit the lovely habit of purity [in all their conduct]; let them show 
forth the sincere disposition of meekness; let them make manifest the command 
which they have of their tongue, by their manner of speaking; let them display 
their love, not by preferring one to another, but by showing equal affection to 
all that piously fear God. Let your children be partakers of true Christian 
training; let them learn of how great avail humility is with God--how much the 
spirit of pure affection can prevail with Him--how excellent and great His fear 
is, and how it saves all those who walk in it with a pure mind. For He is a 
Searcher of the thoughts and desires [of the heart]: His breath is in us; and 
when He pleases, He will take it away. 
<H2 align=center>Chapter 22 </H2>
<H3 align=center>These Exhortations Are Confirmed By The Chrisitan Faith, Which 
Proclaims The Misery Of Sinful Conduct </H3>
<P>Now the faith which is in Christ confirms all these [admonitions]. For He 
Himself by the Holy Ghost thus addresses us: "Come, ye children, hearken unto 
Me; I will teach you the fear of the Lord. What man is he that desireth life, 
and loveth to see good days? Keep thy tongue from evil, and thy lips from 
speaking guile. Depart from evil, and do good; seek peace, and pursue it. The 
eyes of the Lord are upon the righteous, and His ears are [open] unto their 
prayers. The face of the Lord is against them that do evil, to cut off the 
remembrance of them from the earth. The righteous cried, and the Lord heard him, 
and delivered him out of all his troubles." "Many are the stripes [appointed 
for] the wicked; but mercy shall compass those about who hope in the Lord." 
<H2 align=center>Chapter 23 </H2>
<H3 align=center>Be Humble, And Believe That Christ Will Come Again </H3>
<P>The all-merciful and beneficent Father has bowels [of compassion] towards 
those that fear Him, and kindly and lovingly bestows His favours upon those who 
come to Him with a simple mind. Wherefore let us not be double-minded; neither 
let our soul be lifted up on account of His exceedingly great and glorious 
gifts. Far from us be that which is written, "Wretched are they who are of a 
double mind, and of a doubting heart; who say, These things we have heard even 
in the times of our fathers; but, behold, we have grown old, and none of them 
has happened unto us.." Ye foolish ones! compare yourselves to a tree: take [for 
instance] the vine. First of all, it sheds its leaves, then it buds, next it 
puts forth leaves, and then it flowers; after that comes the sour grape, and 
then follows the ripened fruit. Ye perceive how in a little time the fruit of a 
tree comes to maturity. Of a truth, soon and suddenly shall His will be 
accomplished, as the Scripture also bears witness, saying, "Speedily will He 
come, and will not tarry;" and, "The Lord shall suddenly come to His temple, 
even the Holy One, for whom ye look." 
<H2 align=center>Chapter 24 </H2>
<H3 align=center>God Continually Shows Us In Nature That There Will Be A 
Resurrection </H3>
<P>Let us consider, beloved, how the Lord continually proves to us that there 
shall be a future resurrection, of which He has rendered the Lord Jesus Christ 
the first-fruits by raising Him from the dead. Let us contemplate, beloved, the 
resurrection which is at all times taking place. Day and night declare to us a 
resurrection. The night sinks to sleep, and the day arises; the day [again] 
departs, and the night comes on. Let us behold the fruits [of the earth], how 
the sowing of grain takes place. The sower goes forth, and casts it into the 
ground; and the seed being thus scattered, though dry and naked when it fell 
upon the earth, is gradually dissolved. Then out of its dissolution the mighty 
power of the providence of the Lord raises it up again, and from one seed many 
arise and bring forth fruit. 
<H2 align=center>Chapter 25 </H2>
<H3 align=center>The Phoenix, An Emblem Of Our Resurrection </H3>
<P>Let us consider that wonderful sign [of the resurrection] which takes place 
in Eastern lands, that is, in Arabia and the countries round about. There is a 
certain bird which is called a phoenix. This is the only one of its kind, and 
lives five hundred years. And when the time of its dissolution draws near that 
it must die, it builds itself a nest of frankincense, and myrrh, and other 
spices, into which, when the time is fulfilled, it enters and dies. But as the 
flesh decays a certain kind of worm is produced, which, being nourished by the 
juices of the dead bird, brings forth feathers. Then, when it has acquired 
strength, it takes up that nest in which are the bones of its parent, and 
bearing these it passes from the land of Arabia into Egypt, to the city called 
Heliopolis. And, in open day, flying in the sight of all men, it places them on 
the altar of the sun, and having done this, hastens back to its former abode. 
The priests then inspect the registers of the dates, and find that it has 
returned exactly as the five hundredth year was completed. 
<H2 align=center>Chapter 26 </H2>
<H3 align=center>We Shall Rise Again, Then, As The Scriptures Also Testifies 
</H3>
<P>Do we then deem it any great and wonderful thing for the Maker of all things 
to raise up again those that have piously served Him in the assurance of a good 
faith, when even by a bird He shows us the mightiness of His power to fulfil His 
promise ? For [the Scripture] saith in a certain place, "Thou shalt raise me up, 
and I shall confess unto Thee; "and again, "I laid me down, and slept; I awaked, 
because Thou art with me; "and again, Job says, "Thou shalt raise up this flesh 
of mine, which has suffered all these things." 
<H2 align=center>Chapter 27 </H2>
<H3 align=center>In The Hope Of The Resurrection, Let Us Cleave To The 
Omnipotent And Omniscient God </H3>
<P>Having then this hope, let our souls be bound to Him who is faithful in His 
promises, and just in His judgments. He who has commanded us not to lie, shall 
much more Himself not lie; for nothing is impossible with God, except to lie. 
Let His faith therefore be stirred up again within us, and let us consider that 
all things are nigh unto Him. By the word of His might He established all 
things, and by His word He can overthrow them. "Who shall say unto Him, What 
hast thou done ? or, Who shall resist the power of His strength?" When and as He 
pleases He will do all things, and none of the things determined by Him shall 
pass away? All things are open before Him, and nothing can be hidden from His 
counsel. "The heavens declare the glory of God, and the firmament showeth His 
handy-work. Day unto day uttereth speech, and night unto night showeth 
knowledge. And there are no words or speeches of which the voices are not 
heard." 
<H2 align=center>Chapter 28 </H2>
<H3 align=center>God Sees All Things: Therefore Let Us Avoid Transgression </H3>
<P>Since then all things are seen and heard [by God], let us fear Him, and 
forsake those wicked works which proceed from evil desires; so that, through His 
mercy, we may be protected from the judgments to come. For whither can any of us 
flee from His mighty hand? Or what world will receive any of those who run away 
from Him ? For the Scripture saith in a certain place, "Whither shall I go, and 
where shall I be hid from Thy presence? If I ascend into heaven, Thou art there; 
if I go away even to the uttermost parts of the earth, there is Thy right hand; 
if I make my bed in the abyss, there is Thy Spirit." Whither, then, shall any 
one go, or where shall he escape from Him who comprehends all things? 
<H2 align=center>Chapter 29 </H2>
<H3 align=center>Let Us Also Draw Near To God In Purity Of Heart </H3>
<P>Let us then draw near to Him with holiness of spirit, lifting up pure and 
undefiled hands unto Him, loving our gracious and merciful Father, who has made 
us partakers in the blessings of His elect. For thus it is written, "When the 
Most High divided the nations, when He scattered the sons of Adam, He fixed the 
bounds of the nations according to the number of the angels of God. His people 
Jacob became the portion of the Lord, and Israel the lot of His inheritance." 
And in another place [the Scripture] saith, "Behold, the Lord taketh unto 
Himself a nation out of the midst of the nations, as a man takes the 
first-fruits of his threshing-floor; and from that nation shall come forth the 
Most Holy. 
<H2 align=center>Chapter 30 </H2>
<H3 align=center>Let Us Do Those Things That Please God, And Flee From Those He 
Hates, <BR>That We May Be Blessed </H3>
<P>Seeing, therefore, that we are the portion of the Holy One, let us do all 
those things which pertain to holiness, avoiding all evil-speaking, all 
abominable and impure embraces, together with all drunkenness, seeking after 
change, all abominable lusts, detestable adultery, and execrable pride. "For 
God," saith [the Scripture], "resisteth the proud, but giveth grace to the 
humble." Let us cleave, then, to those to whom grace has been given by God. Let 
us clothe ourselves with concord and humility, ever exercising self-control, 
standing far off from all whispering and evil-speaking, being justified by our 
works, and not our words. For [the Scripture] saith, "He that speaketh much, 
shall also hear much in answer. And does he that is ready in speech deem himself 
righteous? Blessed is he that is born of woman, who liveth but a short time: be 
not given to much speaking." Let our praise be in God, and not of ourselves; for 
God hateth those that commend themselves. Let testimony to our good deeds be 
borne by others, as it was in the case of our righteous forefathers. Boldness, 
and arrogance, and audacity belong to those that are accursed of God; but 
moderation, humility, and meekness to such as are blessed by Him. 
<H2 align=center>Chapter 31 </H2>
<H3 align=center>Let Us See By What Means We May Obtain The Divine Blessing 
</H3>
<P>Let us cleave then to His blessing, and consider what are the means of 
possessing it. Let us think over the things which have taken place from the 
beginning. For what reason was our father Abraham blessed? was it not because he 
wrought righteousness and truth through faith? Isaac, with perfect confidence, 
as if knowing what was to happen, cheerfully yielded himself as a sacrifice. 
Jacob, through reason of his brother, went forth with humility from his own 
land, and came to Laban and served him; and there was given to him the sceptre 
of the twelve tribes of Israel. 
<H2 align=center>Chapter 32 </H2>
<H3 align=center>We Are Justified Not By Our Own Works, But By Faith </H3>
<P>Whosoever will candidly consider each particular, will recognise the 
greatness of the gifts which were given by him. For from him have sprung the 
priests and all the Levites who minister at the altar of God. From him also [was 
descended] our Lord Jesus Christ according to the flesh. From him [arose] kings, 
princes, and rulers of the race of Judah. Nor are his other tribes in small 
glory, inasmuch as God had promised, "Thy seed shall be as the stars of heaven." 
All these, therefore, were highly honoured, and made great, not for their own 
sake, or for their own works, or for the righteousness which they wrought, but 
through the operation of His will. And we, too, being called by His will in 
Christ Jesus, are not justified by ourselves, nor by our own wisdom, or 
understanding, or godliness, or works which we have wrought in holiness of 
heart; but by that faith through which, from the beginning, Almighty God has 
justified all men; to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen. 
<H2 align=center>Chapter 33 </H2>
<H3 align=center>But Let Us Not Owe Up The Practice Of Good Works And Love. God 
Himself Is An Example To Us Of Good Works </H3>
<P>What shall we do, then, brethren? Shall we become slothful in well-doing, and 
cease from the practice of love? God forbid that any such course should be 
followed by us! But rather let us hasten with all energy and readiness of mind 
to perform every good work. For the Creator and Lord of all Himself rejoices in 
His works. For by His infinitely great power He established the heavens, and by 
His incomprehensible wisdom He adorned them. He also divided the earth from the 
water which surrounds it, and fixed it upon the immoveable foundation of His own 
will. The animals also which are upon it He commanded by His own word into 
existence. So likewise, when He had formed the sea, and the living creatures 
which are in it, He enclosed them [within their proper bounds] by His own power. 
Above all, with His holy and undefiled hands He formed man, the most excellent 
[of His creatures], and truly great through the understanding given him--the 
express likeness of His own image. For thus says God: "Let us make man in Our 
image, and after Our likeness. So God made man; male and female He created 
them." Having thus finished all these things, He approved them, and blessed 
them, and said, "Increase and multiply." We see, then, how all righteous men 
have been adorned with good works, and how the Lord Himself, adorning Himself 
with His works, rejoiced. Having therefore such an example, let us without delay 
accede to His will, and let us work the work of righteousness with our whole 
strength. 
<H2 align=center>Chapter 34 </H2>
<H3 align=center>Great Is The Reward Of Good Works With God. Joined Together In 
Harmony, Let Us Implore That Reward From Him </H3>
<P>The good servant receives the bread of his labour with confidence; the lazy 
and slothful cannot look his employer in the face. It is requisite, therefore, 
that we be prompt in the practice of well-doing; for of Him are all things. And 
thus He forewarns us: "Behold, the Lord [cometh], and His reward is before His 
face, to render to every man according to his work." He exhorts us, therefore, 
with our whole heart to attend to this, that we be not lazy or slothful in any 
good work. Let our boasting and our confidence be in Him. Let us submit 
ourselves to His will. Let us consider the whole multitude of His angels, how 
they stand ever ready to minister to His will. For the Scripture saith, "Ten 
thousand times ten thousand stood around Him, and thousands of thousands 
ministered unto Him, and cried, Holy, holy, holy, [is] the Lord of Sabaoth; the 
whole creation is full of His glory." And let us therefore, conscientiously 
gathering together in harmony, cry to Him earnestly, as with one mouth, that we 
may be made partakers of His great and glorious promises. For [the Scripture] 
saith, "Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of 
man, the things which He hath prepared for them that wait for Him." 
<H2 align=center>Chapter 35 </H2>
<H3 align=center>Immense Is This Reward. How Shall We Obtain It? </H3>
<P>How blessed and wonderful, beloved, are the gifts of God! Life in 
immortality, splendour in righteousness, truth in perfect confidence, faith in 
assurance, self-control in holiness! And all these fall under the cognizance of 
our understandings [now]; what then shall those things be which are prepared for 
such as wait for Him? The Creator and Father of all worlds, the Most Holy, alone 
knows their amount and their beauty. Let us therefore earnestly strive to be 
found in the number of those that wait for Him, in order that we may share in 
His promised gifts. But how, beloved, shall this be done? If our understanding 
be fixed by faith rewards God; if we earnestly seek the things which are 
pleasing and acceptable to Him; if we do the things which are in harmony with 
His blameless will; and if we follow the way of truth, casting away from us all 
unrighteousness and iniquity, along with all covetousness, strife, evil 
practices, deceit, whispering, and evil-speaking, all hatred of God, pride and 
haughtiness, vainglory and ambition. For they that do such things are hateful to 
God; and not only they that do them, but also those that take pleasure in them 
that do them. For the Scripture saith, "But to the sinner God said, Wherefore 
dost thou declare my statutes, and take my covenant into thy mouth, seeing thou 
hatest instruction, and castest my words behind thee? When thou sawest a thief, 
thou consentedst with him, and didst make thy portion with adulterers. Thy mouth 
has abounded with wickedness, and thy tongue contrived deceit. Thou sittest, and 
speakest against thy brother; thou slanderest thine own mother's son. These 
things thou hast done, and I kept silence; thou thoughtest, wicked one, that I 
should be like to thyself. But I will reprove thee, and set thyself before thee. 
Consider now these things, ye that forget God, lest He tear you in pieces, like 
a lion, and there be none to deliver. The sacrifice of praise will glorify Me, 
and a way is there by which I will show him the salvation of God." 
<H2 align=center>Chapter 36 </H2>
<H3 align=center>All Blessings Are Given To Us Through Christ </H3>
<P>This is the way, beloved, in which we find our Saviour, even Jesus Christ, 
the High Priest of all our offerings, the defender and helper of our infirmity. 
By Him we look up to the heights of heaven. By Him we behold, as in a glass, His 
immaculate and most excellent visage. By Him are the eyes of our hearts opened. 
By Him our foolish and darkened understanding blossoms up anew towards His 
marvellous light. By Him the Lord has willed that we should taste of immortal 
knowledge, "who, being the brightness of His majesty, is by so much greater than 
the angels, as He hath by inheritance obtained a more excellent name than they." 
For it is thus written, "Who maketh His angels spirits, and His ministers a 
flame of fire." But concerning His Son the Lord spoke thus: "Thou art my Son, 
to-day have I begotten Thee. Ask of Me, and I will give Thee the heathen for 
Thine inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for Thy possession." And 
again He saith to Him, "Sit Thou at My right hand, until I make Thine enemies 
Thy footstool." But who are His enemies? All the wicked, and those who set 
themselves to oppose the will of God. 
<H2 align=center>Chapter 37 </H2>
<H3 align=center>Christ Is Our Leader, And We His Soldiers </H3>
<P>Let us then, men and brethren, with all energy act the part of soldiers, in 
accordance with His holy commandments. Let us consider those who serve under our 
generals, with what order, obedience, and submissiveness they perform the things 
which are commanded them. All are not prefects, nor commanders of a thousand, 
nor of a hundred, nor of fifty, nor the like, but each one in his own rank 
performs the things commanded by the king and the generals. The great cannot 
subsist without the small, nor the small without the great. There is a kind of 
mixture in all things, and thence arises mutual advantage. Let us take our body 
for an example. The head is nothing without the feet, and the feet are nothing 
without the head; yea, the very smallest members of our body are necessary and 
useful to the whole body. But all work harmoniously together, and are under one 
common rule for the preservation of the whole body. 
<H2 align=center>Chapter 38 </H2>
<H3 align=center>Let The Members Of The Church Submit Themselves, And No One 
Exalt<BR>Himself Above Another </H3>
<P>Let our whole body, then, be preserved in, Christ Jesus; and let every one be 
subject to his neighbour, according to the special gift bestowed upon him. Let 
the strong not despise the weak, and let the weak show respect unto the strong. 
Let the rich man provide for the wants of the poor; and let the poor man bless 
God, because He hath given him one by whom his need may be supplied. Let the 
wise man display his wisdom, not by [mere] words, but through good deeds. Let 
the humble not bear testimony to himself, but leave witness to be borne to him 
by another. Let him that is pure in the flesh not grow proud of it, and boast, 
knowing that it was another who bestowed on him the gift of continence. Let us 
consider, then, brethren, of what matter we were made,--who and what manner of 
beings we came into the world, as it were out of a sepulchre, and from utter 
darkness. He who made us and fashioned us, having prepared His bountiful gifts 
for us before we were born, introduced us into His world. Since, therefore, we 
receive all these things from Him, we ought for everything to give Him thanks; 
to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen. 
<H2 align=center>Chapter 39 </H2>
<H3 align=center>There Is No Reason For Self-Conceit </H3>
<P>Foolish and inconsiderate men, who have neither wisdom nor instruction, mock 
and deride us, being eager to exalt themselves in their own conceits. For what 
can a mortal man do? or what strength is there in one made out of the dust? For 
it is written, "There was no shape before mine eyes, only I heard a sound, and a 
voice [saying], What then? Shall a man be pure before the Lord? or shall such an 
one be [counted] blameless in his deeds, seeing He does not confide in His 
servants, and has charged even His angels with perversity? The heaven is not 
clean in His sight: how much less they that dwell in houses of clay, of which 
also we ourselves were made! He smote them as a moth; and from morning even 
until evening they endure not. Because they could furnish no assistance to 
themselves, they perished. He breathed upon them, and they died, because they 
had no wisdom. But call now, if any one will answer thee, or if thou wilt look 
to any of the holy angels; for wrath destroys the foolish man, and envy killeth 
him that is in error. I have seen the foolish taking root, but their habitation 
was presently consumed. Let their sons be far from safety; let them be despised 
before the gates of those less than themselves, and there shall be none to 
deliver. For what was prepared for them, the righteous shall eat; and they shall 
not be delivered from evil." 
<H2 align=center>Chapter 40 </H2>
<H3 align=center>Let Us Preserve In The Church The Order Appointed By God </H3>
<P>These things therefore being manifest to us, and since we look into the 
depths of the divine knowledge, it behoves us to do all things in [their proper] 
order, which the Lord has commanded us to perform at stated times. He has 
enjoined offerings [to be presented] and service to be performed [to Him], and 
that not thoughtlessly or irregularly, but at the appointed times and hours. 
Where and by whom He desires these things to be done, He Himself has fixed by 
His own supreme will, in order that all things being piously done according to 
His good pleasure, may be acceptable unto Him. Those, therefore, who present 
their offerings at the appointed times, are accepted and blessed; for inasmuch 
as they follow the laws of the Lord, they sin not. For his own peculiar services 
are assigned to the high priest, and their own proper place is prescribed to the 
priests, and their own special ministrations devolve on the Levites. The layman 
is bound by the laws that pertain to laymen.Chapter 41 
<H3 align=center>Continuation Of The Same Subject </H3>
<P>Let every one of you, brethren, give thanks to God in his own order, living 
in all good conscience, with becoming gravity, and not going beyond the rule of 
the ministry prescribed to him. Not in every place, brethren, are the daily 
sacrifices offered, or the peace-offerings, or the sin-offerings and the 
trespass-offerings, but in Jerusalem only. And even there they are not offered 
in any place, but only at the altar before the temple, that which is offered 
being first carefully examined by the high priest and the ministers already 
mentioned. Those, therefore, who do anything beyond that which is agreeable to 
His will, are punished with death. Ye see, brethren, that the greater the 
knowledge that has been vouchsafed to us, the greater also is the danger to 
which we are exposed. 
<H2 align=center>Chapter 42 </H2>
<H3 align=center>The Order Of Ministers In The Church </H3>
<P>The apostles have preached the Gospel to us from the Lord Jesus Christ; Jesus 
Christ [has done so from God. Christ therefore was sent forth by God, and the 
apostles by Christ. Both these appointments, then, were made in an orderly way, 
according to the will of God. Having therefore received their orders, and being 
fully assured by the resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ, and established in 
the word of God, with full assurance of the Holy Ghost, they went forth 
proclaiming that the kingdom of God was at hand. And thus preaching through 
countries and cities, they appointed the first-fruits [of their labours], having 
first proved them by the Spirit, to be bishops and deacons of those who should 
afterwards believe. Nor was this any new thing, since indeed many ages before it 
was written concerning bishops and deacons. For thus saith the Scripture a 
certain place, "I will appoint their bishops in righteousness, and their deacons 
in faith." 
<H2 align=center>Chapter 43 </H2>
<H3 align=center>Moses Of Old Stilled The Contention Which Arose Concerning The 
Priestly Dignity </H3>
<P>And what wonder is it if those in Christ who were entrusted with such a duty 
by God, appointed those [ministers] before mentioned, when the blessed Moses 
also, "a faithful servant in all his house," noted down in the sacred books all 
the injunctions which were given him, and when the other prophets also followed 
him, bearing witness with one consent to the ordinances which he had appointed? 
For, when rivalry arose concerning the priesthood, and the tribes were 
contending among themselves as to which of them should be adorned with that 
glorious title, he commanded the twelve princes of the tribes to bring him their 
rods, each one being inscribed with the name of the tribe. And he took them and 
bound them [together], and sealed them with the rings of the princes of the 
tribes, and laid them up in the tabernacle of witness on the table of God. And 
having shut the doors of the tabernacle, he sealed the keys, as he had done the 
rods, and said to them, Men and brethren, the tribe whose rod shall blossom has 
God chosen to fulfil the office of the priesthood, and to minister unto Him. And 
when the morning was come, he assembled all Israel, six hundred thousand men, 
and showed the seals to the princes of the tribes, and opened the tabernacle of 
witness, and brought forth the rods. And the rod of Aaron was found not only to 
have blossomed, but to bear fruit upon it. What think ye, beloved? Did not Moses 
know beforehand that this would happen? Undoubtedly he knew; but he acted thus, 
that there might be no sedition in Israel, and that the name of the true and 
only God might be glorified; to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen. 
<H2 align=center>Chapter 44 </H2>
<H3 align=center>The Ordinances Of The Apostles, That There Might Be No 
Contention Respecting The Priestly Office </H3>
<P>Our apostles also knew, through our Lord Jesus Christ, and there would be 
strife on account of the office of the episcopate. For this reason, therefore, 
inasmuch as they had obtained a perfect fore-knowledge of this, they appointed 
those [ministers] already mentioned, and afterwards gave instructions, that when 
these should fall asleep, other approved men should succeed them in their 
ministry. We are of opinion, therefore, that those appointed by them, or 
afterwards by other eminent men, with the consent of the whole Church, and who 
have blame-lessly served the flock of Christ in a humble, peaceable, and 
disinterested spirit, and have for a long time possessed the good opinion of 
all, cannot be justly dismissed from the ministry. For our sin will not be 
small, if we eject from the episcopate those who have blamelessly and holily 
fulfilled its duties. Blessed are those presbyters who, having finished their 
course before now, have obtained a fruitful and perfect departure [from this 
world]; for they have no fear lest any one deprive them of the place now 
appointed them. But we see that ye have removed some men of excellent behaviour 
from the ministry, which they fulfilled blamelessly and with honour. 
<H2 align=center>Chapter 45 </H2>
<H3 align=center>It Is The Part Of The Wicked To Vex The Righteous </H3>
<P>Ye are fond of contention, brethren, and full of zeal about things which do 
not pertain to salvation. Look carefully into the Scriptures, which are the true 
utterances of the Holy Spirit. Observe that nothing of an unjust or counterfeit 
character is written in them. There you will not find that the righteous were 
cast off by men who themselves were holy. The righteous were indeed persecuted, 
but only by the wicked. They were cast into prison, but only by the unholy; they 
were stoned, but only by transgressors; they were slain, but only by the 
accursed, and such as had conceived an unrighteous envy against them. Exposed to 
such sufferings, they endured them gloriously. For what shall we say, brethren? 
Was Daniel s cast into the den of lions by such as feared God? Were Ananias, and 
Azarias, and Mishael shut up in a furnace of fire by those who observed the 
great and glorious worship of the Most High? Far from us be such a thought! Who, 
then, were they that did such things? The hateful, and those full of all 
wickedness, were roused to such a pitch of fury, that they inflicted torture on 
those who served God with a holy and blameless purpose [of heart], not knowing 
that the Most High is the Defender and Protector of all such as with a pure 
conscience venerate" His all-excellent name; to whom be glory for ever and ever. 
Amen. But they who with confidence endured [these things] are now heirs of glory 
and honour, and have been exalted and made illustrious by God in their memorial 
for ever and ever. Amen. 
<H2 align=center>Chapter 46 </H2>
<H3 align=center>Let Us Cleave To The Righteous: Your Strife Is Pernicious </H3>
<P>Such examples, therefore, brethren, it is right that we should follow; since 
it is written, "Cleave to the holy, for those that cleave to them shall 
[themselves] be made holy." And again, in another place, [the Scripture] saith, 
"With a harmless man thou shalt prove thyself harmless, and with an elect man 
thou shalt be elect, and with a perverse man thou shalt show thyself perverse." 
Let us cleave, therefore, to the innocent and righteous, since these are the 
elect of God. Why are there strifes, and tumults, and divisions, and schisms, 
and wars among you? Have we not [all] one God and one Christ? Is there not one 
Spirit of grace poured out upon us? And have we not one calling in Christ? Why 
do we divide and tear to pieces the members of Christ, and raise up strife 
against our own body, and have reached such a height of madness as to forget 
that "we are members one of another?" Remember the words of our Lord Jesus 
Christ, how He said, "Woe to that man [by whom offences come]! It were better 
for him that he had never been born, than that he should cast a stumbling-block 
before one of my elect. Yea, it were better for him that a millstone should be 
hung about [his neck], and he should be sunk in the depths of the sea, than that 
he should cast a stumbling-block before one of my little ones. Your schism has 
subverted [the faith of] many, has discouraged many, has given rise to doubt in 
many, and has caused grief to us all. And still your sedition continueth. 
<H2 align=center>Chapter 47 </H2>
<H3 align=center>Your Recent Discord Is Worse Than The Former Which Took 
Place<BR>In The Times Of Paul </H3>
<P>Take up the epistle of the blessed Apostle Paul. What did he write to you at 
the time when the Gospel first began to be preached? Truly, under the 
inspiration of the Spirit, he wrote to you concerning himself, and Cephas, and 
Apollos, because even then parties had been formed among you. But that 
inclination for one above another entailed less guilt upon you, inasmuch as your 
partialities were then shown towards apostles, already of high reputation, and 
towards a man whom they had approved. But now reflect who those are that have 
perverted you, and lessened the renown of your far-famed brotherly love. It is 
disgraceful, beloved, yea, highly disgraceful, and unworthy of your Christian 
profession, that such a thing should be heard of as that the most stedfast and 
ancient Church of the Corinthians should, on account of one or two persons, 
engage in sedition against its presbyters. And this rumour has reached not only 
us, but those also who are unconnected with us; so that, through your 
infatuation, the name of the Lord is blasphemed, while danger is also brought 
upon yourselves. 
<H2 align=center>Chapter 48 </H2>
<H3 align=center>Let us Return To The Practice Of Brotherly Love </H3>
<P>Let us therefore, with all haste, put an end s to this [state of things]; and 
let us fall down before the Lord, and beseech Him with tears, that He would 
mercifully be reconciled to us, and restore us to our former seemly and holy 
practice of brotherly love. For [such conduct] is the gate of righteousness, 
which is set open for the attainment of life, as it is written, "Open to me the 
gates of righteousness; I will go in by them, and will praise the Lord: this is 
the gate of the Lord: the righteous shall enter in by it." Although, therefore, 
many gates have been set open, yet this gate of righteousness is that gate in 
Christ by which blessed are all they that have entered in and have directed 
their way in holiness and righteousness, doing all things without disorder. Let 
a man be faithful: let him be powerful in the utterance of knowledge; let him be 
wise in judging of words; let him be pure in all his deeds; yet the more he 
seems to be superior to others [in these respects], the more humble-minded ought 
he to be, and to seek the common good of all, and not merely his own advantage. 
<H2 align=center>Chapter 49 </H2>
<H3 align=center>The Praise Of Love </H3>
<P>Let him who has love in Christ keep the commandments of Christ. Who can 
describe the [blessed] bond of the love of God? What man is able to tell the 
excellence of its beauty, as it ought to be told? The height to which love 
exalts is unspeakable. Love unites us to God. Love covers a multitude of sins. 
Love beareth all things, is long-suffering in all things. There is nothing base, 
nothing arrogant in love. Love admits of no schisms: love gives rise to no 
seditions: love does all things in harmony. By love have all the elect of God 
been made perfect; without love nothing is well-pleasing to God. In love has the 
Lord taken us to Himself. On account of the Love he bore us, Jesus Christ our 
Lord gave His blood for us by the will of God; His flesh for our flesh, and His 
soul for our souls. 
<H2 align=center>Chapter 50 </H2>
<H3 align=center>Let us Pray To Be Thought Worthy Of Love </H3>
<P>Ye see, beloved, how great and wonderful a thing is love, and that there is 
no declaring its perfection. Who is fit to be found in it, except such as God 
has vouchsafed to render so? Let us pray, therefore, and implore of His mercy, 
that we may live blameless in love, free from all human partialities for one 
above another. All the generations from Adam even unto this day have passed 
away; but those who, through the grace of God, have been made perfect in love, 
now possess a place among the godly, and shall be made manifest at the 
revelation of the kingdom of Christ. For it is written, "Enter into thy secret 
chambers for a little time, until my wrath and fury pass away; and I will 
remember a propitious day, and will raise you up out of your graves." Blessed 
are we, beloved, if we keep the commandments of God in the harmony of love; that 
so through love our sins may be forgiven us. For it is written, "Blessed are 
they whose transgressions are forgiven, and whose sins are covered. Blessed is 
the man whose sin the Lord will not impute to him, and in whose mouth there is 
no guile." This blessedness cometh upon those who have been chosen by God 
through Jesus Christ our Lord; to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen. 
<H2 align=center>Chapter 51 </H2>
<H3 align=center>Let The Partakers In Strife Acknowledge Their Sins </H3>
<P>Let us therefore implore forgiveness for all those transgressions which 
through any [suggestion] of the adversary we have committed. And those who have 
been the leaders of sedition and disagreement ought to have respect to the 
common hope. For such as live in fear and love would rather that they themselves 
than their neighbours should be involved in suffering. And they prefer to bear 
blame themselves, rather than that the concord which has been well and piously 
handed down to us should suffer. For it is better that a man should acknowledge 
his transgressions than that he should harden his heart, as the hearts of those 
were hardened who stirred up sedition against Moses the servant of God, and 
whose condemnation was made manifest [unto all]. For they went down alive into 
Hades, and death swallowed them up. Pharaoh with his army and all the princes of 
Egypt, and the chariots with their riders, were sunk in the depths of the Red 
Sea, and perished, for no other reason than that their foolish hearts were 
hardened, after so many signs and wonders had been wrought in the land of Egypt 
by Moses the servant of God. 
<H2 align=center>Chapter 52 </H2>
<H3 align=center>Such A Confession Is Pleasing To God </H3>
<P>The Lord, brethren, stands in need of nothing; and He desires nothing of any 
one, except that confession be made to Him. For, says the elect David, "I will 
confess unto the Lord ; and that will please Him more than a young bullock that 
hath horns and hoofs. Let the poor see it, and be glad." And again he saith, 
"Offer unto God the sacrifice of praise, and pay thy vows unto the Most High. 
And call upon Me in the day of thy trouble: I will deliver thee, and thou shalt 
glorify Me." For "the sacrifice of God is a broken spirit." 
<H2 align=center>Chapter 53 </H2>
<H3 align=center>The Love Of Moses Towards His People </H3>
<P>Ye understand, beloved, ye understand well the Sacred Scriptures, and ye have 
looked very earnestly into the oracles of God. Call then these things to your 
remembrance. When Moses went up into the mount, and abode there, with fasting 
and humiliation, forty days and forty nights, the Lord said unto him, "Moses, 
Moses, get thee down quickly from hence; for thy people whom thou didst bring 
out of the land of Egypt have committed iniquity. They have speedily departed 
from the way in which I commanded them to walk, and have made to themselves 
molten images." And the Lord said unto him, "I have spoken to thee once and 
again, saying, I have seen this people, and, behold, it is a stiff-necked 
people: let Me destroy them, and blot out their name from under heaven; and I 
will make thee a great and wonderful nation, and one much more numerous than 
this." But Moses said, "Far be it from Thee, Lord: pardon the sin of this 
people; else blot me also out of the book of the living." O marvellous love! O 
insuperable perfection! The servant speaks freely to his Lord, and asks 
forgiveness for the people, or begs that he himself might perish along with 
them. 
<H2 align=center>Chapter 54 </H2>
<H3 align=center>He Who Is Full Of Love Will Incur Every Loss, That Peace May Be 
<BR>Restored To The Church </H3>
<P>Who then among you is noble-minded? who compassionate? who full of love? Let 
him declare, "If on my account sedition and disagreement and schisms have 
arisen, I will depart, I will go away whithersoever ye desire, and I will do 
whatever the majorit) commands; only let the flock of Christ live on terms of 
peace with the presbyters set over it." He that acts thus shall procure to 
himself great glory in the Lord; and every place will welcome him. For "the 
earth is the Lord's, and the fulness thereof." These things they who live a 
godly life, that is never to be repented of, both have done and always will do. 
<H2 align=center>Chapter 55 </H2>
<H3 align=center>Examples Of Such Love </H3>
<P>To bring forward some examples from among the heathen: Many kings and 
princes, in times of pestilence, when they had been instructed by an oracle, 
have given themselves up to death, in order that by their own blood they might 
deliver their fellow-citizens [from destruction]. Many have gone forth from 
their own cities, that so sedition might be brought to an end within them. We 
know many among ourselves who have given themselves up to bonds, in order that 
they might ransom others. Many, too, have surrendered themselves to slavery, 
that with the price which they received for themselves, they might provide food 
for others. Many women also, being strengthened by the grace of God, have 
performed numerous manly exploits. The blessed Judith, when her city was 
besieged, asked of the elders permission to go forth into the camp of the 
strangers; and, exposing herself to danger, she went out for the love which she 
bare to her country and people then besieged; and the Lord delivered Holofernes 
into the hands of a woman. Esther also, being perfect in faith, exposed herself 
to no less danger, in order to deliver the twelve tribes of Israel from 
impending destruction. For with fasting and humiliation she entreated the 
everlasting God, who seeth all things; and He, perceiving the humility of her 
spirit, delivered the people for whose sake she had encountered peril. 
<H2 align=center>Chapter 56 </H2>
<H3 align=center>Let Us Admonish And Correct One Another </H3>
<P>Let us then also pray for those who have fallen into any sin, that meekness 
and humility may be given to them, so that they may submit, not unto us, but to 
the will of God. For in this way they shall secure a fruitful and perfect 
remembrance from us, with sympathy for them, both in our prayers to God, and our 
mention of them to the saints. Let us receive correction, beloved, on account of 
which no one should feel displeased. Those exhortations by which we admonish one 
another are both good [in themselves] and highly profitable, for they tend to 
unite us to the will of God. For thus saith the holy Word: "The Lord hath 
severely chastened me, yet hath not given me over to death." "For whom the Lord 
loveth He chasteneth, and scourgeth every son whom He receiveth." "The 
righteous," saith it, "shall chasten me in mercy, and reprove me; but let not 
the oil of sinners make fat my head." And again he saith, "Blessed is the man 
whom the Lord reproveth, and reject not thou the warning of the Almighty. For He 
causes sorrow, and again restores [to gladness]; He woundeth, and His hands make 
whole. He shall deliver thee in six troubles, yea, in the seventh no evil shall 
touch thee. In famine He shall rescue thee from death, and in war He shall free 
thee from the power of the sword. From the scourge of the tongue will He hide 
thee, and thou shalt not fear when evil cometh. Thou shalt hugh at the 
unrighteous and the wicked, and shalt not be afraid of the beasts of the field. 
For the wild beasts shall be at peace with thee: then shalt thou know that thy 
house shall be in peace, and the habitation of thy tabernacle shall not fail? 
Thou shall know also that thy seed shall be great, and thy children like the 
grass of the field. And thou shall come to the grave like ripened corn which is 
reaped in its season, or like a heap of the threshing-floor which is gathered 
together at the proper time." Ye see, beloved, that protection is afforded to 
those that are chastened of the Lord; for since God is good, He corrects us, 
that we may be admonished by His holy chastisement. 
<H2 align=center>Chapter 57 </H2>
<H3 align=center>Let The Authors Of Sedition Submit Themselves </H3>
<P>Ye therefore, who laid the foundation of this sedition, submit yourselves to 
the presbyters, and receive correction so as to repent, bending the knees of 
your hearts. Learn to be subject, laying aside the proud and arrogant 
self-confidence of your tongue. For it is better for you that ye should occupy a 
humble but honourable place in the flock of Christ, than that, being highly 
exalted, ye should be cast out from the hope of His people. For thus speaketh 
all-virtuous Wisdom: "Behold, I will bring forth to you the words of My Spirit, 
and I will teach you My speech. Since I called, and ye did not hear; I held 
forth My words, and ye regarded not, but set at naught My counsels, and yielded 
not at My reproofs; therefore I too will laugh at your destruction; yea, I will 
rejoice when ruin cometh upon you, and when sudden confusion overtakes you, when 
overturning presents itself like a tempest, or when tribulation and oppression 
fall upon you. For it shall come to pass, that when ye call upon Me, I will not 
hear you; the wicked shall seek Me, and they shall not find Me. For they hated 
wisdom, and did not choose the fear of the Lord; nor would they listen to My 
counsels, but despised My reproofs. Wherefore they shall eat the fruits of their 
own way, and they shall be filled with their own ungodliness." 
<H2 align=center>Chapter 58 </H2>
<H3 align=center>Blessings Sought For All That Call Upon God </H3>
<P>May God, who seeth all things, and who is the Ruler of all spirits and the 
Lord of all flesh--who chose our Lord Jesus Christ and us through Him to be a 
peculiar people--grant to every soul that calleth upon His glorious and holy 
Name, faith, fear, peace, patience, long-suffering, self-control, purity, and 
sobriety, to the well-pleasing of His Name, through our High Priest and 
Protector, Jesus Christ, by whom be to Him glory, and majesty, and power, and 
honour, both now and for evermore. Amen. 
<H2 align=center>Chapter 59 </H2>
<H3 align=center>Exhortation To Speedily Send Back Word That Peace Has Been 
Restored.<BR>The Benediction </H3>
<P>Send back speedily to us in peace and with joy these our messengers to you: 
Claudius Ephebus and Valerius Bito, with Fortunatus: that they may the sooner 
announce to us the peace and harmony we so earnestly desire and long for [among 
you], and that we may the more quickly rejoice over the good order 
re-established among you. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you, and 
with all everywhere that are the called of God through Him, by whom be to Him 
glory, honour, power, majesty, and eternal dominion, from everlasting to 
everlasting. Amen.
