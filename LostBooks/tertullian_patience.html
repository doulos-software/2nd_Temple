<P align=center>by Tertullian 
<P>
<P align=center>CHAPTER 1 
<P>
<P>Confess to the Lord my God that I certainly have courage, not to say 
presumption, to have dared to write on patience, a virtue which I am utterly 
unfit to practice, being, as I am, a man of no account. For, those who undertake 
to set forth and recommend any virtue should first give some evidence of 
practicing this virtue, and they should give proper direction to their constant 
admonition by the example of their own conduct, lest they be put to the blush at 
the discrepancy between their words and deeds. 
<P>And would that the blushing brought an improvement, that the shame (we feel) 
at not doing what we have suggested to others would teach us to do it! But, of 
course, it is with certain virtues as with certain vices: their greatness is so 
overwhelming that only the grace of divine inspiration can help us to attain and 
practice them. 
<P>For, that which is in the highest sense good belongs in the highest degree to 
God, and no one dispenses it save He who possesses it, to each one as He sees 
fit. 
<P>It will be, then, a comfort to discuss that which it is not granted us to 
enjoy, somewhat in the manner of the sick, who, when deprived of health, cannot 
refrain from proclaiming its blessings. 
<P>Thus, in my pitiable state, ever suffering from the fever of impatience, I 
must sigh after the health of patience which I do not possess, and I must beg 
and beseech it, remembering and reflecting, as I consider my weakness, that one 
does not easily attain the good health of faith and the soundness of the 
discipline of the Lord unless patience lends assistance thereto. 
<P>Patience has been given such pre-eminence in matters pertaining to God that 
no one can fulfill any precept or perform any work pleasing to the Lord without 
patience. 
<P>Even those who do not possess it pay recognition to its excellence by giving 
it the honorable title of 'the highest virtue.' In fact, the philosophers, who 
are regarded as creatures possessing some degree of wisdom, attribute such value 
to it that, while there are disagreements among them because of the various 
inclinations of the schools and their opposing tenets, they are, nevertheless, 
of one mind with regard to patience alone, and in this alone of their interests 
they enter into agreement. With regard to this they are in accord: for this they 
band together, with one mind they apply themselves to it in their efforts to 
attain virtue; every display of wisdom they usher in with a show of patience. 
<P>A great compliment it is to this virtue to be the moving force behind even 
the vain pursuits of the world to their praise and renown! Or is it rather an 
insult that divine things are involved in the doings of the world? 
<P>Let them see to it who will one day be ashamed of their wisdom when it is 
destroyed and brought to disgrace along with this world! 
<P>
<P align=center>CHAPTER 2 
<P>
<P>There has been given to us as a model in the practice of patience no (merely) 
human product fashioned of the dullness of Cynic indifference, but the divine 
ordinance of a life-giving and heavenly way of life which points out as an 
exemplar of patience God Himself. 
<P>Long has He been scattering the brilliance of this light (of the sun) upon 
the just and unjust alike and has allowed the deserving as well as the 
undeserving to enjoy the benefits of the seasons, the services of the elements, 
and the gifts of all creation. 
<P>He endures ungrateful peoples who worship the trifles fashioned by their 
skill and the works of their hands, who persecute His name and His children, and 
who, in their lewdness, their greed, their godlessness and depravity, grow worse 
from day to day; by His patience He hopes to draw them to Himself. There are 
many, you see, who do not believe in the Lord because for so long a time they 
have no experience of His wrath (directed) against the world. 
<P>
<P align=center>CHAPTER 3 
<P align=center>
<P>This is, indeed, a picture of the divine patience which exists, so to speak, 
far away from us, the patience, we might say, which prevails on high. But what 
about that patience which exists openly among men on earth, which is, as it 
were, within our reach? 
<P>God allows Himself to become incarnate: in His mother's womb He awaits (the 
time of birth) and after His birth suffers Himself to grow into manhood, and, 
when an adult, shows no eagerness to become known, but bears reproaches and is 
baptized by His own servant and by His words alone repels the attacks of the 
Tempter. 
<P>When He, (begotten) of the Lord, becomes a master teaching man how to avoid 
death, He teaches him for his own good how to offer reparation to outraged 
patience. 
<P>He did not wrangle or cry aloud; neither did anyone hear His voice in the 
streets; a bruised reed He did not break, a smoking wick He did not quench. 
(Now, the Prophet--or, rather, the testimony of God Himself, placing His own 
spirit in His Son with all patience--has not lied!) 
<P>He did not force one who was unwilling to stay close to Him; He scorned no 
one's table or dwelling; in fact, He ministered personally to His disciples by 
washing their feet. 
<P>He did not despise sinners or publicans, He showed no anger even toward that 
city which refused to receive Him, even when the disciples wished fire from 
heaven to fall upon such a shameful town; He healed the ungrateful, yielded to 
His persecutors. 
<P>More than this, He even kept in His company the one who would betray Him and 
did not firmly denounce him. Why, even when He is betrayed, when He is led like 
a beast to the slaughter--for thus (is it written): 'He does not open His mouth 
any more than does a lamb in the power of its shearer'--He who could have had if 
He wished, at a single word, legions of angels from heaven to assist Him did not 
approve of an avenging sword on the part of even one of His disciples. 
<P>It was the forbearance of the Lord that was wounded in (the person of) 
Malchus. And so, He actually cursed for all time the works of the sword and by 
healing him whom He had not Himself struck, He made satisfaction by forbearance, 
which is the mother of mercy. 
<P>I say nothing about His crucifixion; it was for this that He had come. 
&nbsp;Still, did there have to be such insults attending the death He must 
undergo? &nbsp;No; but as He went forward to His death, He willed to have His 
fill of joy in suffering: He is spat upon, beaten, mocked, disgracefully 
clothed, and even more disgracefully crowned. 
<P>Marvel at the constancy of His meekness: He who had proposed to escape notice 
in the guise of man has in no degree imitated man's impatience. For this reason 
particularly, you Pharisees, you should have recognized the Lord! Patience such 
as this no mere man had ever practiced! 
<P>Such were the manifestations (of His patience), the very magnitude of which 
is the reason why pagan nations reject the faith; for us they are its rational 
foundation. For those to whom there has been granted the gift of faith they 
suffice to make it very clear, not only by the words our Lord used in His 
precepts, but also by the sufferings which He endured, that patience is the very 
nature of God, the effect and manifestation of a certain connatural property (of 
His being). 
<P>
<P align=center>CHAPTER 4 
<P align=center>
<P>Now, if we see that all servants of righteous character and good disposition 
live according to the mind of their lord--obedience, as you know, is a facility 
in rendering service, but the principle of obedience is compliant 
&nbsp;submission--how much more does it behoove us to be found modeled upon our 
Lord! Servants indeed we are of the living God whose sway over His (creatures) 
consists not in manacles or the granting of the slave's cap, but in allotting 
everlasting punishment or salvation. 
<P>To escape His severity or to invite His liberality one needs diligence in 
obeying which is proportionate to the threats uttered by His severity or the 
promises made by His liberality. 
<P>Yet, we ourselves exact obedience not only from men who are bound to us by 
the bonds of slavery or who, because of some other legal bond, are under 
obligation to us, but also from our flocks and even from the wild animals. 
&nbsp;We understand that they have been provided and granted by the Lord for our 
purposes. 
<P>I ask you: in the practice of obedience, shall those creatures which God has 
made subject to us surpass us? In a word, creatures which obey (their masters) 
acknowledge (their condition as creatures): do we hesitate to heed Him to whom 
alone we are subject, namely, the Lord? Why, how unjust it would be, and in 
addition how ungrateful, for you not to make a return of what you have obtained 
from others through the kindness of a third party, to him through whom you 
obtained it! 
<P>But, no more about the manifestation of the obedience which we owe to the 
Lord our God. For, in the act of recognition of God one understands sufficiently 
what is incumbent upon him. However, lest we seem to have inserted something 
irrelevant to this discussion of obedience, (let me remark that) obedience 
itself also stems from patience: never does one who is impatient obey nor does a 
patient man ever refuse obedience. 
<P>Who, then, could deal adequately with the value of that patience which the 
Lord our God, the model and patron of all that is good, has displayed in 
Himself? Who would doubt that those who belong to God have an obligation to 
strive with their whole soul for every good, since it has reference to God? By 
these considerations our recommendation and exhortation on the subject of 
patience is briefly established in a summary, as it were, of the prescribed 
rule. 
<P>
<P align=center>CHAPTER 5 
<P align=center>
<P>Now, to thrash out a question about essential points of faith is not 
wearisome, since it is not without profit. Verboseness, though a fault at times, 
is no fault when it tends to edification. 
<P>Therefore, if some good is being discussed, the matter demands that we 
examine also the evil which is its opposite. You will throw a better light upon 
what one should strive for if you discuss in connection with it what should be 
avoided. 
<P>Let us, then, with regard to impatience, consider whether, as patience 
(exists) in God, its opposite was born and discovered in our adversary. 
&nbsp;From this it will appear how impatience, more than anything else, is 
opposed to faith. 
<P>For, that which is conceived by God's rival is certainly not a friend to the 
things of God. There is the same hostility in the things as there is in their 
authors. Furthermore, since God is infinitely good, and the Devil, on the other 
hand, is superlatively evil, by their very difference they bear witness that 
neither one effects anything for the other; it can no more seem to us that some 
good is produced from evil than some evil from good. 
<P>Now, I find the origin of impatience in the Devil himself. Even when the Lord 
God subjected to His own image, that is, to man, all the works He had made, the 
Devil bore it with impatience. 
<P>For, he would not have grieved, had he endured it, nor would he have envied 
man, had he not grieved; he deceived man because he envied him; he envied him 
because he grieved; he grieved because he certainly had not borne it with 
patience. 
<P>What the angel of perdition was first--I mean, whether he was first evil or 
impatient--I do not bother to inquire; it is clear that, whether impatience had 
its beginning in evil or evil in impatience, they entered into combination and 
grew as one in the bosom of one father. 
<P>For, as soon as he perceived that it was through his impatience that he had 
committed the first sin, having learned from his own experience what would 
assist in wrong-doing, he availed himself of this same impatience to lead men 
into sin. 
<P>Without delay, and would say not without forethought, he contrived a meeting 
with the woman, and simply and solely through their conversation she was touched 
by his breath, already infected with impatience. But never would she have sinned 
at all had she preserved her patience according to the divine command! 
<P>And what of the fact that she could not endure having met (the Devil) alone 
but, being unable to remain silent about it in the presence of Adam--he was not 
yet her husband, nor as yet under any obligation to lend her his ear--she makes 
him the carrier of that which she had imbibed from the Evil One? 
<P>Thus, a second member, too, of the human race falls through the impatience of 
the first; and his fall, too, results from his own impatience committed in two 
ways: with regard to the forewarning of God, and with regard to the deceit of 
the Devil; for he was unable to observe the former or to oppose the latter. 
<P>Condemnation began with him in whom sin originated; God's anger began with 
him by whom man was induced to offend Him. God's patience began with him who had 
aroused His indignation; for at that time He was content with simply cursing him 
and He refrained from inflicting punishment upon the Devil. 
<P>What sin previous to this sin of impatience can be imputed to man? He was 
innocent and a close friend of God and a tenant dwelling in paradise. &nbsp;But, 
when once he yielded to impatience, he ceased to relish God and could no longer 
endure the things of heaven. 
<P>From that time on, as a man delivered up to the earth and cast away from the 
eyes of God, he began to serve as an easy instrument for impatience to use for 
everything that would offend God. 
<P>For, immediately, that impatience which was conceived by the seed of the 
Devil with the fecundity of evil gave birth to a child of wrath and instructed 
its offspring in its own arts. Since it had plunged Adam and Eve into death, it 
taught their son, also, to commit the first murder. 
<P>Vain were it for me to ascribe this sin to impatience, had Cain, the first 
homicide and the first fratricide, accepted it with equanimity and without 
impatience when his offerings were refused by the Lord; if he had not been angry 
with his brother; if, in fine, he had killed no one. 
<P>Therefore, since he could not commit murder unless he were angry, and could 
not be angry unless he were impatient, it proves that what he did in anger is to 
be referred to that which prompted the anger. 
<P>Such was the cradle of impatience which was then, so to speak, in its 
infancy. But to what proportions it soon grew! And no wonder: if it was the 
prime source of sin, it follows that, being the prime source, it was therefore 
also the sole fashioner of all sin, pouring forth from its own abundant 
resources the varied channels of crimes. 
<P>Homicide has already been mentioned. It sprang originally from anger, and 
whatever causes it finds for itself afterwards, it ascribes them to impatience 
at its origin. For, whether one commits this crime through enmity or for some 
gain, the original cause is that one is overwhelmed by hatred or greed. 
<P>Whatever is the motivating force, a crime could not be perpetrated unless one 
lacks patience. Who has ever attempted adultery save one who was unable to 
withstand his lustful desires? Even the fact that (disgrace) is forced upon 
(some) women for a price, that sale of one's honor is certainly set in order by 
an inability to set at naught despicable gain. 
<P>Impatience is, as it were, the original sin in the eyes of the Lord. 
&nbsp;For, to put it in a nutshell, every sin is to be traced back to 
impatience. &nbsp;Evil cannot endure good. No unchaste person but is intolerant 
of chastity; no scoundrel but is irked by righteousness; no negligent person but 
resents his obligations; no agitator but is impatient of peace. Although anyone 
may become evil, not everyone can persevere in good. 
<P>Why, then, should not this hydra-like generator of sins offend the Lord, who 
condemns all wickedness? Is it not clear that Israel itself, through its 
impatience, was ever sinning against God? 
<P>Forgetting the heavenly arm whereby it had been rescued from the afflictions 
of the Egyptians, it demanded of Aaron gods to be its leaders, while it poured 
its contributions into an idol of its own gold. For, it had borne without 
patience the delay necessitated by Moses' meeting with the Lord. 
<P>After the rain of manna as food, after the water that followed and flowed 
from the rock, they gave up hope in the Lord, unable to endure a three-days' 
thirst. For this, too, they were charged with impatience by the Lord. 
<P>But, not to range over individual instances: never would they have been 
destroyed had they not fallen into sin by impatience. Why did they lay hands on 
the Prophets, except that they could not bear to listen to them? &nbsp;And more 
than that: they laid hands upon the Lord Himself, being unable to endure even 
the sight of Him. But had they acquired patience, they would now be free. 
<P>
<P align=center>CHAPTER 6 
<P> 
<P>Such is the patience which is both subsequent to and antecedent to faith. 
Accordingly, Abraham believed in God and it was credited to him by God as 
justice. Now, he proved his faith by patience, when he was commanded to offer in 
sacrifice his son--I do not say for a trial, but rather for a typical 
attestation, of his faith. 
<P>But God knew the man whom He had reputed for his justice. This severe 
command, which the Lord did not intend should be carried out, Abraham heard with 
patience and, had God so willed, he would have fulfilled it. Rightly, then, is 
he blessed because he was faithful; and rightly was he faithful because he was 
patient. 
<P>Thus faith was illuminated by patience, since it was sown among the heathens 
by the seed of Abraham which is Christ and added grace to the Law, and it has 
made patience its helpmate in amplifying and fulfilling the Law, because in 
times past this was the only thing lacking to the teaching of justice. 
<P>Heretofore, men demanded an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth and they 
returned evil for evil. As yet, patience was not found upon the earth, for as 
yet, you see, there was not faith. Meanwhile, impatience was enjoying the 
opportunities occasioned by the Law. It was easy when the Lord and Teacher of 
patience was not on hand. 
<P>But after He came and united the grace of faith with patience, no longer was 
one permitted to do injury with so much as a word, or even say 'Thou fool!' 
without being in danger of the judgment. Wrath was forbidden, passions were kept 
in check, unruly hands were restrained, the poison of the tongue was removed. 
<P>The Law acquired more than it lost when Christ said: 'Love your enemies and 
bless those who curse you and pray for those who persecute you, so that you may 
be children of your Father in heaven.' Just see what a Father patience acquires 
for us! 
<P>
<P align=center>CHAPTER 7 
<P>
<P>The entire practice of patience is compressed within this fundamental precept 
whereby not even a lawful injury is permitted. But now, as we run through the 
causes of impatience, all the other precepts, too, will correspond in their own 
context. 
<P>Is the mind disturbed by the loss of property? In practically every passage 
of the holy Scriptures one is admonished to despise the world, and no greater 
exhortation is there to an indifference toward money than that our Lord Himself 
is without it. &nbsp; 
<P>He always justifies the poor and condemns the rich. Thus He has set disdain 
for wealth ahead of the endurance of losses, pointing out through His rejection 
of riches that one should make no account of the loss of them. 
<P>Hence, we need not seek wealth, since our Lord did not seek it; and we ought 
to bear the deprivation of even the theft of it without regret. &nbsp; 
<P>The Spirit of the Lord, through the Apostle, has called the desire of money 
the root of all evils. We may infer that this consists not only in the desire 
for that which belongs to another; even that which seems to be our own belongs 
to another; for nothing is our own, since all things belong to God to whom we, 
too, belong. 
<P>Therefore, if we feel impatient when we suffer some loss, we will be found to 
possess a desire for money, since we grieve over the loss of that which is not 
our own. We are seeking what belongs to another when we are unwilling to bear 
the loss of that which belongs to another. 
<P>The man who is upset and unable to bear his loss sins, you might say, against 
God Himself by preferring the things of earth to those of heaven. For, the soul 
which he has received from the Lord is upset by the attractiveness of worldly 
goods. 
<P>Let us, then, with glad hearts, relinquish earthly goods that we may preserve 
those of heaven! Let the whole world fall in ruins provided I gain the patience 
to endure it! In all probability, a man who has not resolved to bear with 
fortitude a slight loss occasioned by theft or violence or even by his own 
stupidity will not readily or willingly touch what he owns for the sake of 
charity. 
<P>For, what man who refuses to undergo any operation at all at the hands of 
another puts a knife to his own body? Patience to endure, shown on occasions of 
loss, is a training in giving and sharing. He who does not fear loss is not 
reluctant to give. 
<P>Otherwise, how would one who has two tunics give one of them to him who is 
destitute, unless the same is one who can offer his cloak as well to the one 
going off with his tunic? How will we make friends for ourselves with mammon if 
we love him only to the extent that we do not share in his loss? We shall be 
damned together with the damned. 
<P>What do we find here where we have (only something) to lose? It is for pagans 
to be unable to sustain all loss; they would set worldly goods before their life 
perhaps. 
<P>And they do this when, in their eager desire for wealth, they engage in 
lucrative but dangerous commerce on the sea; when, for money's sake, they 
unhesitatingly engage in transactions also in the forum, even though there be 
reason to fear loss; they do it, in fine, when they hire themselves out for the 
games and military service or when, in desolate regions, they commit robbery 
regardless of the wild beasts. 
<P>On the other hand, in view of the difference between them and ourselves, it 
befits us to give up not our life for money but money for our life, either by 
voluntary charity or by the patient endurance of loss. 
<P>
<P align=center>CHAPTER 8 
<P>
<P>Our very life and our very body we have exposed in this world as a target for 
all manner of injury and we endure this injury with patience; shall we, then, be 
vexed by the deprivation of lesser things? Far be such shame from the servant of 
Christ, that his patience, trained by greater trials, should fail in trifling 
ones! 
<P>If one tries to provoke you to a fight, there is at hand the admonition of 
the Lord: 'If someone strike thee,' He says, ' on the right cheek, turn to him 
the other also.' Let wrong-doing grow weary from your patience; whoever be 
struck, the one who strikes, weighed down by pain and shame, will suffer more 
severely from the Lord; by your meekness you will strike a more severe blow to 
the wrong-doer; for he will suffer at the hands of Him by whose grace you 
practice meekness. 
<P>If a spiteful tongue bursts out in cursing or wrangling, recall the saying: 
'When men reproach you, rejoice.' The Lord Himself was accursed before the Law, 
yet He alone is blessed. Let us, then, His servants, follow our Lord and 
patiently submit to maledictions that we may be blessed! 
<P>If, with slight forbearance, I hear some bitter or evil remark directed 
against me, I may return it, and then I shall inevitably be bitter myself. 
&nbsp;Either that, or I shall be tormented by unexpressed resentment. 
<P>If, then, I retaliate when cursed, how shall I be found to have followed the 
teaching of our Lord? For it has been handed down that a man is not defiled by 
unclean dishes, but by the words which proceed from his mouth; and, what is 
more, that it remains for us to render an account for every vain and idle word. 
<P>It follows, then, that our Lord forbids us to do certain acts, but at the 
same time admonishes us to endure with meekness the same treatment at the hands 
of another. 
<P>(We shall speak) now of the joy which comes from patience. For every injury, 
whether occasioned by the tongue or the hand, coming in contact with patience, 
will meet the same end as a weapon which is flung and dashed upon a hard, 
unyielding rock. An ineffectual and fruitless action will lose its force 
immediately and will sometimes vent its passion and strike with the force of a 
boomerang upon him who sent it forth. 
<P>This is true, of course, since one insults you with the intention of causing 
you pain, because the one who inflicts the injury reaps his reward in the pain 
of the one injured. Consequently, if you cheat him of his reward by not showing 
any pain, he will himself inevitably feel pain because he has lost his reward. 
<P>Then you will go off, not only uninjured (which of itself should suffice for 
you) but over and above that you will have the pleasure of seeing your enemy 
frustrated while you yourself are preserved from pain. Herein lies the advantage 
of patience and the joy which derives from it 
<P>
<P align=center>CHAPTER 9 
<P>
<P>Not even that form of impatience which results from the loss of our dear ones 
is excused, although in this case a sort of rightful claim to grieve justifies 
it. Observance of the precept of the Apostle must be put first: 'Grieve not,' he 
says,' over one who has fallen asleep even as the gentiles who have no hope.' 
<P>And rightly so. For, if we believe in the resurrection of Christ, we believe 
in our own, also, since it was for us that He died and rose again. 
&nbsp;Therefore, since there is sure ground for faith in the resurrection of the 
dead, there is no grief associated with death, and no inability to bear grief. 
<P>Why should you grieve if you believe that (the loved one) has not perished 
utterly? Why should you show impatience that one has been taken away for the 
time being if you believe he will return? That which you think of as death is 
merely the beginning of a journey. He who has gone ahead is not to be mourned, 
though certainly he will be missed. But this lonesomeness must be alleviated by 
patience. Why should you be inconsolable over the departure of one whom you are 
soon to follow? 
<P>Moreover, impatience in such things is a sad indication of our own hope and 
gives the lie to our faith. Likewise, we injure Christ when we fail to accept 
with resignation (the death of) those whom He has called, as though they were to 
be pitied. 
<P>'I desire,' says the Apostle, 'to be welcomed home now and to be with the 
Lord.' How much better a prayer he holds forth! As for the Christians' prayer, 
then, if we bear it with impatience and grief that others have attained their 
goal, we ourselves do not want to attain our goal! 
<P>
<P align=center>CHAPTER 10 
<P>
<P>There is another, and very strong, motive which gives rise to impatience, 
namely, the desire for revenge, which busies itself in the interest of either 
reputation or wrong-doing. Now, reputation is everywhere empty, and evil never 
fails to be hateful to the Lord, especially in this situation when, occasioned 
by wrong-doing on the part of another, it takes the upper hand in executing 
vengeance and, in paying back the evil, does twice as much as was done in the 
first place. 
<P>Revenge mistakenly appears to be a soothing of one's pain, but in the light 
of truth it is seen to be only evil contending with evil. What difference is 
there between the one who provokes and the one provoked except that the one is 
caught doing wrong sooner than the other? &nbsp;Nevertheless, before the Lord 
each is guilty of having injured a fellow man and the Lord forbids and condemns 
every act of wrong-doing. 
<P>There is no hierarchical arrangement in wrong-doing, nor does position make 
any distinction in that which similarity makes one. Therefore, the precept is 
unequivocally laid down: evil is not to be rendered for evil. &nbsp;Like deed 
merits like treatment. 
<P>But how shall we observe this precept if, in loathing (evil), we have no 
loathing for revenge? What tribute of honor shall we offer to the Lord our God 
if we assume to ourselves the right to inflict punishment? 
<P>We who are matter subject to decay, vessels of clay, are grievously offended 
when our servants take it upon themselves to seek revenge from their fellow 
slaves; as for those who show us patience, we not only praise them as slaves who 
are conscious of their lowly position, men attentive to the respect they owe 
their lord, but we recompense them even more than they had themselves 
anticipated. Is there any risk for us in such a course when we have a Lord so 
just in His judgments, so powerful in His deeds? 
<P>Why, then, do we believe Him a judge, but not also an avenger? Of this He 
assures us when He says: 'Revenge is mine and I will repay them,' that is: 'Have 
patience with Me and I will reward your patience.' 
<P>When He says: 'Do not judge, that you may not be judged,' is He not demanding 
patience? What man will refrain from judging another except one who will forego 
(the right) of self-defense? What man judges with the intention of forgiving? 
And if he does forgive, he has but shied away from the impatience of a man who 
judges and has usurped the honor of the true Judge, that is, God! 
<P>What misfortunes has such impatience, as a rule, brought upon itself! 
&nbsp;How often has it regretted its self-defense! How often has its obstinacy 
become worse than the occasions which provoked it! Now, nothing undertaken 
through impatience can be transacted without violence, and everything done with 
violence has either met with no success or has collapsed or has plunged to its 
own destruction. 
<P>If you are too mild in your self-defense, you will be acting like a madman; 
if your defense is excessive, you will be depressed. Why should I be concerned 
about revenge when I cannot regulate its extent because of my inability to 
endure pain? Whereas, if I yield and suffer the injury, I shall have no pain; 
and if I have no pain, I shall have no desire for revenge. 
<P>
<P align=center>CHAPTER 11 
<P>
<P>Now that we have, to the best of our ability, set forth these principal 
provocations to impatience in the order of their intensity, with which of the 
rest that (we encounter) at home and in public life should we concern ourselves? 
Widespread and extensive are the workings of the Evil One who extends 
innumerable incentives to impatience which, at times, are slight, at times very 
great. 
<P>The slight ones you should ignore for their insignificance; to the great you 
should yield in view of their invincible power. When the injury is not very 
important, there is no need for impatience, but when the injury is more serious, 
then there is greater need for a remedy against the injury, namely, patience. 
<P>Let us strive, then, to bear the injuries that are inflicted by the Evil One, 
that the struggle to maintain our self-control may put to shame the enemy's 
efforts. If, however, through imprudence or even of our own free will we draw 
down upon ourselves some misfortune, we should submit with equal patience to 
that which we impute to ourselves. 
<P>But if we believe some blow of misfortune is struck by God, to whom would it 
be better that we manifest patience than to our Lord? In fact, more than this, 
it befits us to rejoice at being deemed worthy of divine chastisement: 'As for 
me,' He says, 'those whom I love I chastise.' Blessed is that servant upon whose 
amendment the Lord insists, at whom He deigns to be angry, whom He does not 
deceive by omitting His admonition! 
<P>From every angle, then, we are obliged to practice patience, because we meet 
up with our own mistakes or the wiles of the Evil One or the warnings of the 
Lord alike. Great is the recompense for practicing it, namely, happiness. 
<P>Whom has the Lord declared happy? Those who are patient; for He said: 
'Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.' 
&nbsp;Assuredly, no one but the humble man is poor in spirit. And who is humble 
but the man who is patient? No one can take a position of subjection without 
patience, the prime factor in subjection. 
<P>'Blessed,' He says, 'are those who weep and mourn.' Who can endure such 
things without patience? To such, then, is consolation and joy promised. &nbsp; 
<P>'Blessed are the meek.' Certainly, in this word one cannot by any means 
include the impatient. Likewise, when He applies this same title of happiness to 
the peace-makers and calls them the children of God, I ask you: Do the impatient 
share in this peace? Only a fool would think so! 
<P>And when He says: 'Rejoice and exult when men reproach you and persecute you 
because your reward is great in heaven,' certainly this promise of great joy is 
not made to the impatient, for no one will rejoice in adversity unless he has 
first come to despise it; no one will despise it unless he possesses patience. 
<P>
<P align=center>CHAPTER 12 
<P>
<P>As for what pertains to the practice of this peace so pleasing to God (I ask 
you): What man, completely given over to impatience, will forgive his brother, I 
will not say seven times and seventy times seven times, but even once? 
<P>What man, taking his case with his adversary to a judge, will settle his 
trouble to the accommodation of the other party, unless he first puts an end to 
his wrath, his resentment, his harshness and bitterness, that is, his impatient 
disposition? 
<P>How will you forgive and experience forgiveness if you cling to your injury 
through a total lack of patience? No one whose mind is violently disturbed 
against his brother will complete his offering at the altar unless first he has 
been reconciled to his brother through patience. &nbsp; 
<P>If the sun goes down upon our anger, we are in danger. We may not live a 
single day without patience. Yet, since patience governs every aspect of a 
salutary way of life, what wonder that it also paves the way for repentance 
which, as a rule, comes to the assistance of those who have fallen? 
<P>What benefits it produces in both parties when, in spite of their forbearance 
from their marriage rights--provided it be only for that reason which makes it 
lawful for a man or woman to persist in their separation--it waits for, hopes 
for, wins by its prayers repentance for those who will eventually be saved. It 
purifies the one without causing the other to become an adulterer! 
<P>So, too, in those examples in our Lord's parables there is a breath of 
patience: it is the patience of the shepherd that seeks and finds the straying 
sheep (for impatience would readily take no account of a single sheep, whereas 
patience undertakes the wearisome search) and he carries it on his shoulders, a 
patient bearer of a forsaken sinner. 
<P>In the case of the prodigal son, too, it is the patience of his father that 
welcomes him and clothes him and feeds him and finds an excuse for him in the 
face of the impatience of his angry brother. The one who had perished is 
rescued, therefore, because he embraced repentance; repentance is not wasted 
because it meets up with patience! 
<P>Consider now charity, the great bond of faith, the treasure of the Christian 
religion, which the Apostle extols with all the power of the Holy Spirit: how is 
it learned except by the exercise of patience? 
<P>'Charity,' he says, 'is magnanimous.' It derives this from patience. 
&nbsp;'It is kind.' Patience works no evil. 'It does not envy.' Envy is 
certainly a characteristic of impatience. 'It is not pretentious.' It has 
derived its contentment from patience. 'It is not puffed up, is not ambitious,' 
for that does not befit patience. 'It is not self-seeking.' It suffers (the loss 
of) its own goods provided that it be to another's advantage. 'It is not 
provoked.' What, then, would it have left to impatience? Therefore, he says, 
'charity bears with all things, endures all things.' Of course it does, because 
it is itself patient. 
<P>He is correct, then, in stating that it will never fall away. Everything else 
will pass away and come to an end. Tongues, knowledge, prophecies are made void, 
but there persist faith, hope, and charity: &nbsp; faith, which the patience of 
Christ has instilled; hope, to which the patience of man looks forward; charity, 
which patience accompanies, according to the teaching of God. 
<P>
<P align=center>CHAPTER 13 
<P>
<P>Thus far (we have been speaking), however, of a patience which constitutes 
simply and uniformly and solely an operation of the soul, whereas in various 
ways we should strive for this same patience also in the body in order to attain 
the good pleasure of the Lord, inasmuch as it was practiced by the Lord Himself 
as a virtue also of the body; for the soul, as the directing agent, readily 
shares the inspirations of the Spirit with that wherein it dwells. 
<P>What, then, is the operation of patience in the body? Primarily, 
mortification of the flesh as a sacrifice acceptable to the Lord. This is an 
offering of (one's) humility, since it offers to the Lord a sacrifice of 
mourning dress along with meager rations, contenting itself with plain food and 
a drink of clear water, joining fast with fast and persevering in sackcloth and 
ashes. 
<P>This patience on the part of the body contributes to the value of our 
petitions and strengthens our prayers for deliverance. It opens the ears of 
Christ our God, dispels His severity, elicits His mercy. 
<P>Thus, after offending the Lord, the King of Babylon lived for seven years in 
squalor and filth, an exile from human society. By this offering of the patient 
endurance of bodily (discomfort) not only did he regain his kingdom, but--and 
this is even more desirable in a man--he made satisfaction to God. 
<P>Now, if we go on to consider the higher and more blessed degrees of bodily 
patience, (we see that) it turns continence, too, into an opportunity for 
sanctity: this it is which preserves the widow (in her state), places its seal 
upon the virgin, and raises to the kingdom of heaven one who of his own free 
will embraces a life of celibacy. 
<P>That which derives from the power of the soul finds its fulfillment in the 
flesh. In persecutions the endurance of the flesh engages in battle. If flight 
besets one, the flesh surmounts the hardships of flight. If imprisonment 
precludes flight, it is the flesh which submits to the chains, the block of 
wood, and the bare ground. It is the flesh which endures both the scanty light 
(of the dungeon) and the deprivation of worldly comforts. 
<P>But, when one is led forth to the ordeal that will prove his happiness, to 
the opportunity to renew one's baptism, to the very ascent to the throne of 
divinity, there is nothing (which avails) more in that situation than endurance 
on the part of the body. If the spirit is willing but the flesh--without 
patience--weak, where is there salvation for the spirit as well as for the flesh 
itself? 
<P>On the other hand, when the Lord speaks thus of the flesh and declares it 
weak, He points out what is needed for strengthening it, namely, patience in the 
face of everything that is ready to overthrow our faith and impose a penalty for 
it, that one may bear with constancy stripes, and fire, the cross, wild beasts, 
or the sword as the Prophets and Apostles bore them and won the victory. 
<P>
<P align=center>CHAPTER 14 
<P>
<P>In virtue of his power of endurance, Isaias, though cut in pieces, does not 
refrain from speaking of the Lord. Stephen, as he is stoned, prays for pardon 
for his enemies. 
<P>Happy, too, was that man who displayed every manner of patience against every 
vicious attack of the Devil! His flocks were driven away, his wealth in cattle 
destroyed by lightning, his children killed at a single stroke when his house 
collapsed, his own body, finally, was tortured by painful sores --yet, by none 
of these was he lured from his patience and the trust he owed the Lord. Though 
the Devil struck him with all his strength, he struck in vain! 
<P>Far from being turned away by so many misfortunes from the reverence which he 
owed to God, he set for us an example and proof of how we must practice patience 
in the spirit as well as in the flesh, in soul as well as in body, that we may 
not succumb under the loss of worldly goods, the death of our dear ones, or any 
bodily afflictions. 
<P>What a trophy over the Devil God erected in the case of that man! What a 
banner of His glory He raised above His enemy when that man let fall from his 
lips no other word than 'Thanks be to God!' as each bitter message reached him; 
when he severely rebuked his wife who, weary by now of misfortunes, was urging 
him to improper remedies. 
<P>How God laughed, and how the Evil One was split asunder, when Job, with 
perfect calm, would wipe away the discharge oozing from his ulcer and, with a 
jesting remark, would call back to the cavity and sustenance of his open flesh 
the tiny creatures that were trying to make their way out! &nbsp; 
<P>Thus did that hero who brought about a victory for his God beat back all the 
darts of temptation and with the breastplate and shield of patience soon after 
recover from God complete health of body and the possession of twice as much as 
he had lost. 
<P>Had he wanted his sons to be restored, too, he would once again have heard 
himself called 'father.' But he preferred that they be restored to him on the 
last day; placing all his trust in the Lord, he deferred that great joy; for the 
prevent, he was willing to endure the loss of his children that he might not 
live without something to suffer! 
<P>
<P align=center>CHAPTER 15 
<P>
<P>God is fully capable of being the trustee of our patience: if you place in 
His hands an injustice you have suffered, He will see that justice is done; if a 
loss, He will see that you receive compensation; if a pain, He acts as healer; 
if death, He restores life. How much is granted to patience that it should have 
God for a debtor! 
<P>And not without reason. For it pays attention to all His prescriptions, it 
becomes surety for all His commands: it strengthens faith, governs peace, 
sustains love, instructs humility, awaits repentance, places its seal upon the 
discipline of penance, controls the flesh, preserves the spirit, puts restraint 
upon the tongue, holds back the (violent) hand, treads under foot temptations, 
pushes scandal aside, consummates martyrdom. 
<P>In poverty it supplies consolation; upon wealth it imposes moderation; the 
sick it does not destroy, nor does it, for the man in health, prolong his life; 
for the man of faith it is a source of delight. It attracts the heathen, 
recommends the slave to his master, the master to God. It adorns a woman, 
perfects a man. It is loved in a child, praised in a youth, esteemed in the 
aged. In both man and woman, at every age of life, it is exceedingly attractive. 

<P>Now, then! If you will, let us try to grasp the features and appearance of 
patience. Its countenance is peaceful and untroubled. Its brow is clear, 
unruffled by any lines of melancholy or anger. The eyebrows are relaxed, giving 
an impression of joyousness. The eyes are lowered, in an attitude rather of 
humility than moroseness. 
<P>The mouth is closed in becoming silence. Its complexion is that of the serene 
and blameless. It shakes its head frequently in the direction of the Devil, and 
its laughter conveys a threat to him. The upper part of its garment is white and 
close-fitting so that it is not blown about or disturbed (by the wind). 
<P>It sits on the throne of its spirit which is extremely mild and gentle and is 
not whipped into a knot by the whirlwind, is not made livid by a cloud, but is a 
breeze of soft light, clear and simple, such as Elias saw the third time. For 
where God is, there, too, is the child of His nurturing, namely, patience. 
<P>When the Spirit of God descends, patience is His inseparable companion. If we 
fail to welcome it along with the Spirit, will the latter remain within us at 
all times? As a matter of fact, I rather think the Spirit would not remain at 
all. Without its companion and assistant it would feel very uncomfortable 
anywhere and at any time. It could not endure, all by itself, the blows which 
its enemy inflicts, if stripped of the means which helps it to endure. 
<P>
<P align=center>CHAPTER 16 
<P>
<P>This is the theory, this the practice, this the operation of the patience 
which is divine and true, namely, Christian; a patience not like the patience 
practiced by the peoples of the earth, which is false and disgraceful. 
<P>For, that the Devil might rival the Lord in this respect, also, and be really 
on an equal footing with Him as it were (except that good and evil are extremes 
of equal magnitude) the Devil also taught his own a special brand of patience. 
<P>It is a patience, I say, which renders subject to the power of their wives 
husbands who are purchased by a dowry or who negotiate with panderers; a 
patience in virtue of which (a wife) bears, with feigned affection, all the 
irritation resulting from a forced association so that, as a childless widow, 
she may lay hands upon her husband's estate; a patience which sentences 
gormandizers to sacrifice their freedom and become disgraceful slaves to their 
gluttony. 
<P>Such are the goals of patience as the heathens know it and by such despicable 
efforts they appropriate the name of so noble a virtue; they live in patient 
endurance of their rivals, the wealthy, and their hosts; it &nbsp;is only God 
alone whom they cannot endure. But let their patience and the patience of their 
chief take care: there is fire beneath the earth awaiting this kind of patience. 

<P>Let us, then, love the patience that is of God, the patience of Christ; let 
us return to Him that which He expended for us; let us who believe in the 
resurrection of the flesh and of the spirit offer Him both the patience of the 
spirit and the patience of the flesh.
