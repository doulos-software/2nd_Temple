 <title>The Secret Gospel of Mark</title>

<body>

<h1>The Secret Gospel of Mark </h1>

<p><i><b>The Secret Gospel of Mark</b>, the text here, is only a portion of a scripture
the author (said to be Clement of Alexandria) claims to be in the
custody of the Headquarters of the Church in Alexandria, but whose existence is publicly
refuted, so as to battle the copies circulated by the infamous sect of the <b>Carpocrations </b>.</i> </p>

<p><i>This letter was found by <b>Morton Smith</b> in the Mar Saba monastery, southeast of
Jerusalem, in 1958.</i> <br>
<i>Translation by Morton Smith.</i> </p>

<hr>

<p>From the letters of the most holy Clement, the author of the Stromateis. To Theodore. </p>

<p>You did well in silencing the unspeakable teachings of the Carpocrations. For these are
the <i>&quot;wandering stars&quot;</i> referred to in the prophecy, who wander from the
narrow road of the commandments into a boundless abyss of the carnal and bodily sins. For,
priding themselves in knowledge, as they say, <i>&quot;of the deep things of Satan&quot;</i>,
they do not know that they are casting themselves away into <i>&quot;the nether world of
the darkness&quot; </i>of falsity, and boasting that they are free, they have become
slaves of servile desires. Such men are to be opposed in all ways and altogether. For,
even if they should say something true, one who loves the truth should not, even so, agree
with them. For not all true things are the truth, nor should that truth which merely seems
true according to human opinions be preferred to the true truth, that according to the
faith. </p>

<p>Now of the things they keep saying about the divinely inspired Gospel according to
Mark, some are altogether falsifications, and others, even if they do contain some true
elements, nevertheless are not reported truly. For the true things, being mixed with
inventions, are falsified, so that, as the saying goes, even the salt loses its savor. </p>

<p>As for Mark, then, during Peter's stay in Rome he wrote an account of the Lord's
doings, not, however, declaring all of them, nor yet hinting at the secret ones, but
selecting what he thought most useful for increasing the faith of those who were being
instructed. But when Peter died a martyr, Mark came over to Alexandria, bringing both his
own notes and those of Peter, from which he transferred to his former book the things
suitable to whatever makes for progress toward knowledge. Thus he composed a more
spiritual Gospel for the use of those who were being perfected. Nevertheless, he yet did
not divulge the things not to be uttered, nor did he write down the hierophantic teaching
of the Lord, but to the stories already written he added yet others and, moreover, brought
in certain sayings of which he knew the interpretation would, as a mystagogue, lead the
hearers into the innermost sanctuary of that truth hidden by seven veils. Thus, in sum, he
prepared matters, neither grudgingly nor incautiously, in my opinion, and, dying, he left
his composition to the church in 1, verso Alexandria, where it even yet is most carefully
guarded, being read only to those who are being initiated into the great mysteries. </p>

<p>But since the foul demons are always devising destruction for the race of men,
Carpocrates, instructed by them and using deceitful arts, so enslaved a certain presbyter
of the church in Alexandria that he got from him a copy of the secret Gospel, which he
both interpreted according to his blasphemous and carnal doctrine and, moreover, polluted,
mixing with the spotless and holy words utterly shameless lies. From this mixture is drawn
off the teaching of the Carpocratians. </p>

<p>To them, therefore, as I said above, one must never give way; nor, when they put
forward their falsifications, should one concede that the secret Gospel is by Mark, but
should even deny it on oath. For, <i>&quot;Not all true things are to be said to all
men&quot;</i>. For this reason the Wisdom of God, through Solomon, advises, <i>&quot;Answer
the fool from his folly&quot;</i>, teaching that the light of the truth should be hidden
from those who are mentally blind. Again it says, <i>&quot;From him who has not shall be
taken away&quot;</i>, and <i>&quot;Let the fool walk in darkness&quot;</i>. But we are <i>&quot;children
of Light&quot;</i>, having been illuminated by <i>&quot;the dayspring&quot;</i> of the
spirit of the Lord <i>&quot;from on high&quot;</i>, and <i>&quot;Where the Spirit of the
Lord is&quot;</i>, it says, <i>&quot;there is liberty&quot;</i>, for <i>&quot;All things
are pure to the pure&quot;</i>. </p>

<p>To you, therefore, I shall not hesitate to answer the questions you have asked,
refuting the falsifications by the very words of the Gospel. For example, after <i>&quot;And
they were in the road going up to Jerusalem&quot;</i> and what follows, until <i>&quot;After
three days he shall arise&quot;</i>, the secret Gospel brings the following material word
for word: </p>

<p><i>&quot;And they come into Bethany. And a certain woman whose brother had died was
there. And, coming, she prostrated herself before Jesus and says to him, 'Son of David,
have mercy on me.' But the disciples rebuked her. And Jesus, being angered, went off with
her into the garden where the tomb was, and straightway a great cry was heard from the
tomb. And going near, Jesus rolled away the stone from the door of the tomb. And
straightaway, going in where the youth was, he stretched forth his hand and raised him,
seizing his hand. But the youth, looking upon him, loved him and began to beseech him that
he might be with him. And going out of the tomb, they came into the house of the youth,
for he was rich. And after six days Jesus told him what to do, and in the evening the
youth comes to him, wearing a linen cloth over his naked body. And he remained with him
that night, for Jesus taught him the mystery of the Kingdom of God. And thence, arising,
he returned to the other side of the Jordan.&quot;</i> </p>

<p>After these words follows the text, <i>&quot;And James and John come to him&quot;</i>,
and all that section. But <i>&quot;naked man with naked man,&quot;</i> and the other
things about which you wrote, are not found. </p>

<p>And after the words, <i>&quot;And he comes into Jericho,&quot;</i> the secret Gospel
adds only, <i>&quot;And the sister of the youth whom Jesus loved and his mother and Salome
were there, and Jesus did not receive them.&quot;</i> But the many other things about
which you wrote both seem to be, and are, falsifications. </p>

<p>Now the true explanation, and that which accords with the true philosophy ... </p>
